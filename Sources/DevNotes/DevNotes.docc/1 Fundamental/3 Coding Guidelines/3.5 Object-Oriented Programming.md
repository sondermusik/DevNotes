# 3.5 Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

_Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) basics in Swift: understanding classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism for efficient and organized code._

## Introduction to OOP in Swift

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of structuring code by organizing related data and functionality into "objects." Each object is an instance of a class, representing a specific concept or entity within an application. OOP makes code more modular, easier to understand, and allows us to create reusable and extendable components. Swift, as an OOP language, provides key OOP principles to support robust code structure and design.

In Swift, OOP is used across Apple platforms, making it essential for building high-quality applications on macOS, iOS, visionOS, and beyond.

## Key Concepts of OOP

OOP has four main principles:
1. **Classes and Objects**
2. **Inheritance**
3. **Encapsulation**
4. **Polymorphism**

Let’s dive into each with practical Swift examples.

### 1. Classes and Objects

**Class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines properties (data) and methods (functions) that an object can have.

**Object**: An object is an instance of a class, containing actual data and the behavior defined by its class.

#### Defining a Class and Creating an Object in Swift

```swift
class Car {
    var brand: String
    var year: Int
    
    init(brand: String, year: Int) {
        self.brand = brand
        self.year = year
    }
    
    func startEngine() {
        print("\(brand) engine started.")
    }
}

// Creating an object (instance) of Car
let myCar = Car(brand: "Tesla", year: 2024)
myCar.startEngine() // Output: Tesla engine started.
```

Here, Car is a class with properties brand and year and a method startEngine(). 
myCar is an instance of the Car class.

### 2. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. 
The class inheriting is called a subclass, and the class it inherits from is the superclass.
This reduces code repetition and enables code reusability.

#### Example of Inheritance in Swift

```swift
class ElectricCar: Car {
    var batteryLife: Int
    
    init(brand: String, year: Int, batteryLife: Int) {
        self.batteryLife = batteryLife
        super.init(brand: brand, year: year)
    }
    
    override func startEngine() {
        print("\(brand) is running silently with battery life of \(batteryLife)%.")
    }
}

let myElectricCar = ElectricCar(brand: "Tesla", year: 2024, batteryLife: 100)
myElectricCar.startEngine() // Output: Tesla is running silently with battery life of 100%.
```

In this example, ElectricCar inherits from Car and adds a new property batteryLife. 
It also overrides the startEngine method to provide specific behavior for electric cars.

### 3. Encapsulation
Encapsulation restricts direct access to certain properties or methods of a class,
hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what’s necessary. 
This is achieved using access modifiers like private, fileprivate, and public.

#### Encapsulation Example in Swift

```swift
class BankAccount {
    private var balance: Double = 0.0
    
    func deposit(amount: Double) {
        balance += amount
    }
    
    func withdraw(amount: Double) -> Bool {
        if amount <= balance {
            balance -= amount
            return true
        } else {
            print("Insufficient funds")
            return false
        }
    }
    
    func checkBalance() -> Double {
        return balance
    }
}

let myAccount = BankAccount()
myAccount.deposit(amount: 1000)
print(myAccount.checkBalance()) // Output: 1000.0

// myAccount.balance = 500 // Error: 'balance' is inaccessible due to 'private' protection level
```
Here, balance is a private property, making it accessible only within the BankAccount class.
External code cannot modify balance directly, preserving the integrity of the account's data.

### 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows methods to perform different tasks
based on the object calling the method. 
This is typically achieved through method overriding or protocols in Swift.

#### Example of Polymorphism Using Method Overriding
```swift
class Animal {
    func sound() {
        print("This animal makes a sound")
    }
}

class Dog: Animal {
    override func sound() {
        print("The dog barks")
    }
}

class Cat: Animal {
    override func sound() {
        print("The cat meows")
    }
}

let animals: [Animal] = [Dog(), Cat()]

for animal in animals {
    animal.sound()
}
// Output:
// The dog barks
// The cat meows
```

In this example, both Dog and Cat classes 
override the sound method from the Animal superclass. 
This allows each subclass to provide its specific implementation of sound.

## Why Use OOP?

OOP is especially useful in larger projects as it:

Organizes Code
Grouping related data and functionality in classes 
makes code easier to navigate and understand.

Promotes Code Reusability
Inheritance allows for shared functionality, reducing code duplication.

Supports Modularity
Encapsulation keeps classes focused on specific tasks, 
making it easier to test, debug, and extend.

Simplifies Maintenance
Changes to one part of the code are less likely to impact unrelated parts, 
especially when encapsulation is used correctly.

## Common OOP Pitfalls

While OOP is powerful, there are some potential pitfalls:

Overuse of Inheritance
Relying too heavily on inheritance can lead to complex hierarchies. 
Swift provides protocol-oriented programming as an alternative, 
allowing for more flexibility.

Large, Unfocused Classes
Classes should follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), 
handling only one task or function.

Exposing Internal Data
Avoid exposing properties that shouldn’t be modified externally. 
Use encapsulation to protect data integrity.

## Conclusion

Understanding the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Swift 
is essential for writing clean, modular, and reusable code. 

By using classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, 
you can create applications that are efficient and scalable. 
Swift’s approach to OOP is flexible, allowing you to leverage both 
traditional OOP techniques and more modern protocol-oriented approaches 
to structure your applications for maintainability and growth.
