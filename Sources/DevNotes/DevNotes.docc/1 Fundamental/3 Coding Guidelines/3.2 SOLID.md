3.2 Core Principles of Code Design: SOLID

A guide to applying the SOLID principles for building clean, scalable, and maintainable Swift code.

Introduction

The SOLID principles are five core design principles that help developers create clear, efficient, and maintainable code. Following SOLID improves software architecture by making code easier to understand, extend, and test. These principles are essential for developing high-quality software, especially in Swift, where maintainability and performance are crucial for modern, cross-platform, high-performance applications.

This guide introduces each SOLID principle with an explanation and a Swift example.

SOLID Principles Overview

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
Open-Closed Principle (OCP) - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but should depend on abstractions.
Let’s explore each principle and see how it applies to Swift code.

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should only have one responsibility or reason to change. Each class should focus on a single task or function to keep the code organized and reduce complexity.

Example: Let’s say we have a UserManager class that handles user authentication and user data persistence. This class is doing too much.

// Violates SRP
class UserManager {
    func authenticate(user: String, password: String) -> Bool {
        // Authentication logic
    }
    
    func saveUser(user: User) {
        // Save user data logic
    }
}
Solution: Separate the responsibilities into different classes:

class AuthService {
    func authenticate(user: String, password: String) -> Bool {
        // Authentication logic
    }
}

class UserStorage {
    func saveUser(user: User) {
        // Save user data logic
    }
}
Now, AuthService handles authentication, while UserStorage manages data persistence.

2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Code should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that adding new features should not require changing existing code, which minimizes the risk of introducing bugs.

Example: Imagine we have a DiscountCalculator that calculates different types of discounts. Adding a new discount type should not require modifying the existing code.

// Violates OCP
class DiscountCalculator {
    func calculateDiscount(for customerType: String) -> Double {
        if customerType == "Regular" {
            return 0.1
        } else if customerType == "Premium" {
            return 0.2
        }
        return 0.0
    }
}
Solution: Use protocols to make the code extensible:

protocol Discount {
    func calculate() -> Double
}

class RegularDiscount: Discount {
    func calculate() -> Double {
        return 0.1
    }
}

class PremiumDiscount: Discount {
    func calculate() -> Double {
        return 0.2
    }
}

class DiscountCalculator {
    func calculateDiscount(_ discount: Discount) -> Double {
        return discount.calculate()
    }
}
Now, adding new discount types doesn’t require changing existing code—just add new classes that conform to the Discount protocol.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes without changing the program's correctness. This ensures that subclasses only extend functionality, not alter base functionality.

Example: Suppose we have a Bird class and an Ostrich subclass. An ostrich cannot fly, so Ostrich might override the fly() method, breaking LSP.

class Bird {
    func fly() {
        print("Flying")
    }
}

class Ostrich: Bird {
    override func fly() {
        // Ostriches can't fly, so this would break LSP
    }
}
Solution: Refactor the hierarchy so that Bird only includes functionality that all birds share. Create a FlyingBird subclass for birds that can fly.

class Bird {
    // Shared properties of birds
}

class FlyingBird: Bird {
    func fly() {
        print("Flying")
    }
}

class Ostrich: Bird {
    // Ostrich-specific properties
}
Now, Ostrich doesn’t inherit the fly() method, preserving LSP.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don’t use. Instead of creating large protocols, split them into smaller, more specific protocols.

Example: Consider an Animal protocol that requires both fly() and swim() methods. Classes that conform to this protocol but don’t need all methods are forced to implement unnecessary functions.

// Violates ISP
protocol Animal {
    func fly()
    func swim()
}

class Fish: Animal {
    func fly() {
        // Fish can't fly
    }
    
    func swim() {
        print("Swimming")
    }
}
Solution: Separate the protocol into smaller, more specific protocols.

protocol Flyable {
    func fly()
}

protocol Swimmable {
    func swim()
}

class Fish: Swimmable {
    func swim() {
        print("Swimming")
    }
}

class Bird: Flyable {
    func fly() {
        print("Flying")
    }
}
Now, Fish only needs to conform to Swimmable, and Bird conforms to Flyable, keeping the code clean and adhering to ISP.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

Example: Let’s say we have a DatabaseManager class directly used by UserManager. This tightly couples UserManager to DatabaseManager, making it harder to test and modify.

class DatabaseManager {
    func save(user: User) {
        // Save user to database
    }
}

class UserManager {
    let databaseManager = DatabaseManager()
    
    func saveUser(user: User) {
        databaseManager.save(user: user)
    }
}
Solution: Define an abstraction (protocol) and let UserManager depend on the abstraction instead of a concrete implementation.

protocol UserStorage {
    func save(user: User)
}

class DatabaseManager: UserStorage {
    func save(user: User) {
        // Save user to database
    }
}

class UserManager {
    let storage: UserStorage
    
    init(storage: UserStorage) {
        self.storage = storage
    }
    
    func saveUser(user: User) {
        storage.save(user: user)
    }
}
Now, UserManager depends on the UserStorage abstraction, which makes it easier to swap out implementations for testing or future modifications.

Summary

Applying SOLID principles helps build code that is easier to understand, test, and extend. These principles are especially useful for Swift applications where maintainability and scalability are important, like in cross-platform or high-performance projects. By using SOLID, you create a robust foundation for code that can grow and adapt over time.
