DriverKit Development

A comprehensive guide on using DriverKit to develop drivers for macOS, with a focus on high-performance applications and modern driver development best practices.

Overview

DriverKit, introduced by Apple as an extension to macOS, allows developers to create user-space drivers for macOS hardware. Unlike the older I/O Kit, which required kernel-level drivers, DriverKit operates in user space, providing a safer and more stable environment. This guide covers the fundamentals of DriverKit, its structure, advantages, and the practical steps required to develop, test, and deploy drivers using DriverKit.

Key Features of DriverKit
User-Space Drivers: DriverKit drivers operate in user space, significantly enhancing system security and stability by isolating drivers from the kernel.
System Extensions: DriverKit uses system extensions (SDExtensions), which macOS can enable or disable without rebooting, providing a more dynamic driver environment.
Enhanced Permissions and Security: With a sandboxed environment and user-consent prompts for driver installation, DriverKit enforces high security.
Robust I/O Support: DriverKit offers a comprehensive set of classes and protocols for interacting with hardware, from USB and PCI to HID devices.
Developing Drivers with DriverKit
Developing a driver with DriverKit involves setting up a System Extension, configuring the driver within the DriverKit framework, and testing across supported macOS versions.

Prerequisites for DriverKit Development

Xcode 12 or later: Ensure you are using the latest Xcode version to access DriverKit tools.
Developer ID: DriverKit drivers require a Developer ID with the appropriate entitlements.
DriverKit Entitlements: Request entitlements specific to DriverKit, as drivers interact directly with system hardware.
Project Setup
Create a System Extension Target: In Xcode, set up a new System Extension target for your driver.
Request Permissions: Add entitlements required by your driver in the Entitlements.plist file.
Define DriverKit Entitlements: Include necessary DriverKit permissions such as com.apple.developer.driverkit.transport.usb for USB drivers.
Example: Creating a USB Driver with DriverKit

DriverKit provides several classes specifically for USB, allowing straightforward driver development for USB devices. Below is a basic outline of creating a USB driver with DriverKit:

Setup: Add a USB System Extension target in Xcode.
Import DriverKit Frameworks: Import necessary frameworks in your code.
Define Driver Properties: Use IOService properties and matching dictionaries to specify the device your driver will manage.
Sample Code for Initializing a USB Driver

import DriverKit
import USBDriverKit

class MyUSBDriver: IOService, IOUSBHostDevice {
    override func start(_ provider: IOService) -> Bool {
        super.start(provider)
        print("USB Driver started")
        // Additional initialization code here
        return true
    }

    override func stop(_ provider: IOService) {
        super.stop(provider)
        print("USB Driver stopped")
    }
}
Core Classes and Protocols in DriverKit
DriverKit provides a range of classes and protocols tailored for different types of hardware interfaces:

IOService: The base class for all DriverKit drivers, managing the lifecycle of drivers and interactions with hardware devices.
IOUSBHostDevice: Specifically for USB devices, this class handles USB communication, including device identification and endpoint management.
IOPCIDevice: Manages PCI-based hardware connections, facilitating direct access to PCI device properties.
IOUserNetworkEthernet: A specialized class for network drivers, allowing driver development for network adapters and handling packet transmission.
Each of these classes provides essential methods for configuring, managing, and communicating with respective hardware components.

Permissions and Security
DriverKit enforces strict permissions and requires user consent before enabling a driver. This helps safeguard system security by ensuring that only authorized drivers can interact with macOS hardware.

Setting Entitlements for DriverKit

Entitlements are required to authorize your driver to communicate with specific hardware. These are set in your project’s Entitlements.plist file. For example, enabling USB access in DriverKit requires adding the com.apple.developer.driverkit.transport.usb entitlement.

<key>com.apple.developer.driverkit.transport.usb</key>
<true/>
Handling User Consent and Notifications
macOS prompts users to allow System Extensions to load. When testing your driver, use the following steps to handle user consent:

Allow Extension in System Preferences: After installing the driver, navigate to System Preferences > Security & Privacy to approve the driver.
Check System Console for Logs: macOS logs messages for driver approval and loading status. This can be useful during development.
Testing DriverKit Drivers
Testing DriverKit drivers requires a robust process due to the sensitive nature of driver interactions with hardware. Apple provides tools within Xcode and macOS for testing and debugging drivers.

Using Xcode for DriverKit Testing

System Extension Debugging: Use Xcode’s debug tools to attach to running driver processes and step through code.
System Console: Monitor the System Console for messages related to driver startup, errors, and interaction logs.
System Extensions CLI: The systemextensionsctl command-line tool can load, unload, and manage System Extensions. This is useful for testing driver load/unload behaviors.
System Extension Commands

Use systemextensionsctl to manage System Extensions during development.

# List all active System Extensions
systemextensionsctl list

# Unload a specific System Extension
systemextensionsctl uninstall <TeamID> <ExtensionBundleID>
Common Challenges and Solutions
DriverKit drivers, while more secure than kernel-level drivers, come with their own set of challenges:

Debugging Limitations: DriverKit’s sandboxing can make debugging more challenging. Use Xcode and System Console logs for detailed insights.
User Consent Requirements: macOS requires user permission to load drivers, which can slow down development. During testing, ensure that all permissions and entitlements are properly set.
Limited Hardware Access: Not all hardware components are accessible via DriverKit. In cases where kernel-level access is required, consult Apple’s documentation for alternatives.
Deployment and Distribution
Deploying DriverKit drivers requires careful attention to distribution and entitlement management.

Driver Signing and Notarization: Ensure your driver is signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple for security.
User Approval and Extension Activation: After installation, macOS prompts the user to allow the driver. This ensures that only authorized drivers are loaded on the system.
Driver Updates: For updates, macOS allows seamless driver replacement, provided the updated driver passes notarization and user approval.
DriverKit Best Practices
To create efficient, secure, and reliable drivers using DriverKit, follow these best practices:

Minimize Privilege Use: Only request entitlements necessary for your driver’s function, reducing potential security risks.
Test Across macOS Versions: Ensure compatibility by testing drivers across macOS versions, particularly for features that may change in updates.
Follow Apple’s System Extension Guidelines: Use Apple’s best practices for managing and updating System Extensions to ensure your driver performs well in all scenarios.
Use DriverKit Logging: Implement structured logging to help diagnose issues, especially in production environments where live debugging is not feasible.
Summary
DriverKit offers a modern approach to macOS driver development, prioritizing security and stability by running drivers in user space. By following this guide, you’ll be able to set up, configure, and deploy DriverKit-based drivers that are efficient, secure, and optimized for high-performance applications. From handling USB and PCI devices to network drivers, DriverKit provides a versatile and robust framework for developing macOS drivers that meet Apple’s latest standards. With structured testing and best practices, you can create drivers that integrate seamlessly with macOS, benefiting from enhanced stability and security while delivering high-performance results.
