# 5.5 Accessibility
_Create accessible, adaptable, and inclusive apps with scalable text, VoiceOver support, and accessibility features._

## Introduction

Accessibility and Dynamic Type are essential for designing applications that serve everyone, including users with disabilities. Apple provides extensive tools and guidelines for building apps that adapt to various needs across iOS, macOS, and other Apple platforms. This article covers how to make Swift applications accessible by implementing Dynamic Type, VoiceOver support, accessibility elements, and testing techniques to meet Apple's standards.

## What is Dynamic Type?

Dynamic Type allows users to adjust system-wide text sizes, and your app should respect these settings for improved readability and accessibility. Supporting Dynamic Type creates a native experience that’s responsive and user-friendly. Both SwiftUI and UIKit offer tools for implementing Dynamic Type, making it easy to scale text without sacrificing layout or design.

### Implementing Dynamic Type in UIKit and SwiftUI

**UIKit**: Use `UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle:)` to automatically scale text according to user preferences. Enable `adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory` to ensure the font resizes dynamically with system settings.

```swift
let label = UILabel()
label.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .body)
label.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true
SwiftUI: Apply styles like .body or .title to Text elements, and SwiftUI will automatically scale the text based on user settings.

Text("Hello, World!")
    .font(.body) // Automatically supports Dynamic Type
Supporting Custom Fonts with Dynamic Type

If you’re using custom fonts, ensure they work with Dynamic Type by using UIFontMetrics in UIKit or .scaledFont in SwiftUI to adjust text size.

UIKit Custom Font Example:

let customFont = UIFont(name: "CustomFontName", size: 17)!
let fontMetrics = UIFontMetrics(forTextStyle: .body)
label.font = fontMetrics.scaledFont(for: customFont)
label.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true
SwiftUI Custom Font Example:

Text("Custom Font Example")
    .font(.custom("CustomFontName", size: 17, relativeTo: .body))
Responsive Layout Adjustments
For Dynamic Type, use flexible layouts like UIStackView in UIKit or VStack/HStack in SwiftUI to accommodate larger text sizes. Test with various accessibility settings to ensure content scales properly without truncation or overlap.

Accessibility Basics: Key Features for Inclusivity

Apple’s accessibility APIs provide essential tools to make your app usable by everyone, including those with vision, hearing, and motor impairments. Here’s how to implement accessibility features like labels, hints, traits, and actions.

1. Accessibility Labels
Accessibility Labels provide descriptions for elements like buttons, images, or icons, which VoiceOver reads aloud. Labels should be concise yet descriptive.

UIKit Example:

button.accessibilityLabel = "Save Document"
imageView.accessibilityLabel = "User Profile Picture"
SwiftUI Example:

Image("userProfile")
    .accessibilityLabel("User Profile Picture")
2. Accessibility Hints
Accessibility Hints offer additional context about an element’s function, helpful for interactive elements like buttons.

UIKit Example:

button.accessibilityHint = "Saves the current document"
SwiftUI Example:

Button("Save", action: saveDocument)
    .accessibilityHint("Saves the current document")
3. Accessibility Traits and Custom Actions
Accessibility Traits describe an element’s role, like .button, .header, or .link. Custom actions can provide additional VoiceOver commands.

UIKit Example:

button.accessibilityTraits = [.button, .destructive]
SwiftUI Example:

Button("Delete", action: deleteItem)
    .accessibility(addTraits: .isDestructive)
4. Grouping Elements for a Logical Reading Flow
Group related elements so VoiceOver treats them as a single unit. In SwiftUI, use .accessibilityElement(children:).

SwiftUI Example:

VStack {
    Text("Username: John Doe")
    Text("Age: 30")
}
.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)
5. Managing Accessibility Focus and Reading Order
Control reading order with .accessibilitySortPriority(). Higher priority elements are read first.

SwiftUI Example:

Text("Title").accessibilitySortPriority(1)
Text("Subtitle").accessibilitySortPriority(0)
Advanced Accessibility for High-Quality Desktop Apps

For large-scale desktop applications, advanced accessibility features enhance usability and compliance with Apple’s accessibility standards.

Keyboard Accessibility
Desktop apps should fully support keyboard navigation. In macOS, use NSResponder to manage keyboard events, and UIKeyCommand in UIKit for shortcuts.

UIKit Example:

override var keyCommands: [UIKeyCommand]? {
    return [
        UIKeyCommand(input: "R", modifierFlags: .command, action: #selector(refreshPage), discoverabilityTitle: "Refresh Page")
    ]
}
Accessibility for Custom Controls
For custom controls like sliders or toggles, define accessibility labels, values, and hints. Use accessibilityValue to convey the control’s state.

UIKit Example:

let slider = UISlider()
slider.accessibilityLabel = "Volume"
slider.accessibilityValue = "50 percent"
VoiceOver Rotor Support
For content-heavy applications, consider VoiceOver rotor support to help users navigate by headings, links, or other key elements. Use UIAccessibilityCustomRotor in UIKit to define custom rotor items.

Additional Accessibility Considerations

Focus Management for Desktop Apps (macOS)
In macOS, NSAccessibilityElement and NSAccessibilityCustomAction can be used to define custom accessibility elements, enabling focus on specific parts of the interface.

Screen Reader Notifications
Notify users of status changes, such as completion or errors, using UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:) in UIKit or .accessibilityAction in SwiftUI.

Example:

UIAccessibility.post(notification: .announcement, argument: "Download Complete")
Accessible Animations
Respect the “Reduce Motion” setting (UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled) to adjust or disable animations for users sensitive to motion.

Handling “Reduce Transparency”
In macOS and iOS, consider simplifying visual effects when the "Reduce Transparency" setting is enabled to enhance readability.

Localized Accessibility Support
Ensure accessibility labels, hints, and custom actions are localized to serve a global user base.

Accessible Notifications and Alerts
Use alert roles (in macOS) or .accessibilityAlert() in SwiftUI for notifications to treat them as priority messages for screen readers.

Accessibility for Data Tables
For data-heavy apps, particularly on macOS, NSTableView should use proper accessibility row and column descriptions. In SwiftUI, use .accessibilityElement(children: .contain) for tables.

Accessible Drag-and-Drop
For draggable items, add custom accessibility labels and hints, especially in productivity or design applications on macOS.

Testing Accessibility in Xcode

Testing accessibility is essential for high-quality app development. Xcode’s Accessibility Inspector identifies and addresses accessibility issues.

Accessibility Testing Checklist
VoiceOver: Enable VoiceOver to ensure meaningful labels and descriptions for all elements.
Dynamic Type Scaling: Test at various text sizes to validate layout responsiveness.
Color Contrast: Use the Accessibility Inspector to verify sufficient text/background contrast.
Keyboard Navigation: Test full keyboard navigation, especially for desktop apps.
Using the Accessibility Inspector
The Accessibility Inspector in Xcode is a powerful tool for previewing and validating accessibility traits, labels, hints, and colors.

Steps:

Open Xcode > Developer Tools > Accessibility Inspector.
Select UI elements to check labels, hints, and traits.
Use the Color Contrast Checker for accessible color choices.
Summary

Comprehensive accessibility in Swift applications includes more than Dynamic Type and VoiceOver support; it involves clear labels, flexible layouts, logical grouping, keyboard navigation, responsive design, and advanced customizations. Following these best practices will ensure your app is inclusive, high-quality, and compliant with Apple’s accessibility guidelines.

By building accessible apps, you create a seamless experience that benefits all users and increases the reach of your application across Apple’s ecosystem.
