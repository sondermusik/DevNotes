# 2.3 Best Practices for Commits

_Essential guidelines for structuring 
commit names, tags, and messages 
to enhance clarity and maintainability in version control._

---

## Introduction

Using a structured approach to commits in Git (or other version control systems) 
is critical for maintaining clarity in your project’s history. 

Clear, intentional commits help teams collaborate effectively, 
debug more easily, and understand project progression over time. 
In Swift development, where codebases can grow complex across platforms and applications,
consistent commit practices are key for maintaining quality and readability. 

In this guide, we’ll dive into best practices for 
naming, tagging, and writing commit messages. 
Additionally, we’ll outline a system you can adopt for your own projects
to keep commits informative and organized.

## Best Practice for Version Control

**Commit Often**  
    Regular commits on feature branches 
    make it easier to track changes and resolve conflicts.

**Keep Commits to a Single Purpose**  
    Each commit should focus on **one aspect** of the codebase.
    Break down your work into multiple commits,
    each reflecting a meaningful step in development. 
    This practice makes it easier for other developers to follow your changes 
    and for you to track down issues if they arise.

**Write Descriptive Commit Messages**  
    Clear messages help teammates and yourself 
    to understand the purpose of each change.

**Use Pull Requests for Reviews**  
    When merging, use a pull request 
    to enable code review and discussion, 
    catching potential issues early.

**Keep the Main Branch Stable**:  
    Only merge tested and verified changes 
    to prevent regressions.

**Handle Conflicts Mindfully**:  
    Resolve merge conflicts carefully 
    and test the merged code to ensure stability.

**Use Branches for Features and Fixes**:  
    Create a branch for each new feature or bug fix 
    to isolate work until it’s ready to integrate.

**Regularly Pull from the Main Branch**: 
    Sync your branch with the main branch often 
    to minimize conflicts during merge.

**Automate Testing with CI/CD**:  
    For high-speed Swift projects, automate tests to run 
    on every branch merge to prevent bugs from reaching `main`.


## 2. Systematic Commit Methodology

To maintain a clear and organized commit history, 
it’s important to structure your commits in a way 
that makes it easy to find and understand changes across the project. 
This practice is critical for maintaining quality and readability.

Before committing, consider the following guidelines:

## 2.1 Establishing Commit Types

The first step in commit organization is a standardized naming convention. 

By beginning each commit with a clear, all-caps Type in square brackets
you can quickly identify the purpose and type of change. 

This practice ensures every commit is self-explanatory at a glance, 
saving time when reviewing history or during code reviews.

### Recommended Type System

Here’s a set of standard types of commits, designed to cover common kinds of changes:

| Type     | Purpose                          | Example                          |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `[ADD]`  | Adding a new feature or module   | `[ADD] Dark mode theme`          |
| `[FIX]`  | Fixing a bug or issue            | `[FIX] Crash on launch`          |
| `[CLEAN]`| Code cleanup and refactoring     | `[CLEAN] Remove unused imports`  |
| `[DOC]`  | Documentation changes            | `[DOC] Update README`            |
| `[FEAT]` | New feature                      | `[FEAT] Image caching`       |
| `[TEST]` | Adding or modifying tests        | `[TEST] Add unit tests for login`|
| `[PERF]` | Performance improvements         | `[PERF] Optimize image loading`  |
| `[CHORE]`| Miscellaneous tasks              | `[CHORE] Update dependencies`    |

These tags standardize commit categories, 
making it easier to locate specific types of changes in the project’s history. 

**Always use all-caps** for the tags to maintain uniformity and visibility in the commit log.

## 2. Using Tags Efficiently

Beyond standard change types, use additional tags 
to track significant milestones or development phases. 
This enhances visibility of major project transitions or version stages:

### 1. **Development Stage Tags**

Label major stages in development to mark significant milestones, such as:
- `BETA` for commits to a beta version.
- `RC` for release candidates.
- `STABLE` for stable, production-ready releases.

### 2. **Project-Specific Tags**

- If working on large, multi-module projects, 
consider adding tags for specific modules or features, like `UI` or `BACKEND`. 
- This adds context to the commit scope, 
especially when multiple developers contribute across different areas of the codebase.

### 3. **Urgency or Priority Tags**:  
    
- For urgent fixes or high-priority tasks, add tags like `HOTFIX` or `PRIORITY`. 
- These help team members quickly identify commits that need immediate attention
or are critical to the project's stability.

By combining standard commit tags with project-specific and stage-specific labels,
you can create a well-organized commit log that is intuitive and quick to navigate.

## 3. Writing Good Commit Messages

A well-crafted commit message provides concise, clear information about what was changed and why. When writing commit messages, remember that they should help anyone—whether it's you, your teammates, or future contributors—understand the intent and details of each change.

### General Structure for Commit Messages

Follow this structure to ensure messages are both informative and easy to read:

1. **First Line**: Summary
   - A concise summary (50 characters or less) starting with the tag, followed by a short description.
   - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add new dark mode theme").
   
2. **Second Line**: Blank (Optional)
   - Separate the summary from the details with a blank line for readability.

3. **Third Line**: Details (Optional but Recommended)
   - If needed, add a detailed description explaining the motivation behind the change, how it was implemented, and any other relevant details. Keep each line within 72 characters for readability.

## 4. A Systematic Approach for Commit Messages

To maintain consistent commit quality, adopt a process for reviewing and refining each message:

### 1. **Use the Tag and Summary First**:  
- Begin every message with the tag
- followed by a brief summary of the change

This helps identify the type and purpose of the change at a glance.

### 2. **Include a Reasonable Level of Detail**: 
If a commit is complex or affects multiple areas, 
add a brief explanation below the summary line. 
Focus on "why" the change was made rather than "how" to keep messages concise.

### 3. **Proofread Before Committing**: 
- Quickly review the message for clarity and conciseness. 
- Ensure the message fully explains the commit's impact.

### 4. **Limit Commits to a Single Purpose**: 
Each commit should ideally focus on one aspect of the codebase 
(e.g., a feature, bug fix, or code cleanup). 
This practice not only clarifies the commit history 
but also makes it easier to revert specific changes if necessary.


## Examples of Good Commit Messages

Here are examples that use this structure, along with our naming convention:

1. **Example 1** - Adding a New Feature
```
[FEAT] Add support for dark mode theme

This feature introduces a dark mode theme option in settings. 
Updated UI components and colors to adapt to dark mode, 
ensuring consistency across the app.
```
2. **Example 2** - Fixing a Bug
```
[FIX] Resolve crash when opening profile screen

Fixed a null reference in the profile view controller, 
which was causing the app to crash on devices with certain configurations.
```

3. **Example 3** - Code Cleanup
```
[CLEAN] Remove unused import statements

Removed redundant imports from several modules to streamline compilation and reduce potential merge conflicts in future updates.
```

4. **Writing a Series of Commits for a New Feature**

Let’s say you’re implementing a "User Profile" feature.
Here’s a systematic approach for each stage of the feature, 
with examples of how to structure commits:

1. **Initial Setup**  
- **Commit**: `[ADD] Initial User Profile module setup`
- **Message**: Set up the basic module structure for the User Profile feature. Created `UserProfileViewController` and storyboard references.

2. **Implement Core UI Elements**  
- **Commit**: `[ADD] Add User Profile UI elements`
- **Message**: Added layout elements (profile picture, name, bio) to `UserProfileViewController`. Set up constraints for responsive layout.

3. **Integrate Data Models**  
- **Commit**: `[FEAT] Integrate User data model with Profile view`
- **Message**: Linked `User` model to `UserProfileViewController`. Updated UI to display user information dynamically.

4. **Add Data Fetching Logic**  
- **Commit**: `[FEAT] Add data fetching for User Profile`
- **Message**: Added network request in `UserProfileManager` to fetch profile data. Updated `UserProfileViewController` to handle async data loading.

5. **Handle Error States and Loading Indicators**  
- **Commit**: `[FIX] Add loading indicator and error handling`
- **Message**: Implemented loading spinner and basic error handling for profile data loading. Displays alert on network errors.

6. **Write Unit Tests**  
- **Commit**: `[TEST] Add tests for User Profile data loading`
- **Message**: Added unit tests for `UserProfileManager` data fetching, including successful data load and error cases.

7. **Performance Optimization**  
- **Commit**: `[PERF] Optimize profile image loading`
- **Message**: Implemented caching for profile images to improve loading performance. Images are cached locally to reduce redundant network requests.

8. **Final Cleanup and Documentation**  
- **Commit**: `[CLEAN] Refactor and clean up User Profile code`
- **Message**: Cleaned up `UserProfileViewController` and removed unused methods. Added comments for better readability.


This approach breaks down the feature into manageable commits, each focused on a single, clear purpose. If an issue arises during testing, it’s easy to trace back to the exact change that may have introduced it.

Using systematic commit naming, effective tagging, and clear messaging will create a more navigable, understandable project history. Follow these practices consistently to help team members and future contributors understand changes, debug more easily, and maintain a high standard of quality in your codebase.

In summary:

1. **Commit Naming**: Start every commit message with a tag in square brackets for easy identification.
2. **Tags**: Use tags for both change types and project milestones to organize commits and highlight important changes.
3. **Message Structure**: Use a summary and optional details to convey the purpose and scope of each commit clearly.

This approach will ensure a cleaner, more professional commit log that is easier to manage and review. By adhering to these best practices, you’ll streamline version control processes and make collaboration smoother, especially on large or long-term projects.
