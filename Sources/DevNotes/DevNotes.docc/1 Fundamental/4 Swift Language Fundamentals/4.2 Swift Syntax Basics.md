# 4.2 Swift Syntax Basics

_A foundational overview of Swift’s syntax for variables, operators, and control flow._

Swift is a modern programming language designed to be powerful yet easy to use. 
Mastering Swift’s basic syntax is essential for creating efficient, 
safe, and readable code across all Apple platforms. 
This guide covers core syntax elements, including variables, constants, 
operators, and control flow, designed to bring new developers up to speed 
with Swift and refresh fundamental concepts 
for those transitioning from other languages.

## Variables and Constants

### Declaring Variables and Constants
In Swift, we use 
- `let` to declare constants (values that can’t change) 
- `var` for variables (values that can change)

```swift
let maximumLoginAttempts = 3  // Constant
var currentLoginAttempt = 0   // Variable
```
- Constants (let) are immutable; use them whenever the value will not change after being set.
- Variables (var) are mutable and allow values to change over time.

## Type Inference and Explicit Types
Swift is type-safe and uses type inference to detect types from initial values.
However, you can also specify types explicitly.
```swift
let userName = "John Doe"           // Type inferred as String
var score: Int = 100                // Explicitly typed as Int
```

## Type Annotations
Use type annotations if the type is not immediately clear from the context.
```swift
var greeting: String = "Hello"
```

## Basic Operators

Swift includes many familiar operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. 

Here are some of the most common:

### Arithmetic Operators
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Remainder (%)
let sum = 10 + 5       // 15
let product = 10 * 5   // 50
let remainder = 10 % 3 // 1
### Comparison Operators
Equal to (==)
Not equal to (!=)
Greater than (>)
Less than (<)
Greater than or equal to (>=)
Less than or equal to (<=)
let isEqual = (5 == 5) // true
let isGreater = (10 > 5) // true
### Logical Operators
Logical NOT (!)
Logical AND (&&)
Logical OR (||)
let isLoggedIn = true
let hasAdminRights = false
let canAccessAdminPanel = isLoggedIn && hasAdminRights // false

## Nil-Coalescing Operator
The nil-coalescing operator (??) provides a default value for an optional.

let username: String? = nil
let displayName = username ?? "Guest" // "Guest"

## Control Flow

Control flow structures allow you to direct your code’s execution 
based on conditions and loops.

### If-Else Statements
Use if to run code based on conditions, optionally adding else and else if for additional cases.

let age = 20
if age >= 18 {
    print("You are an adult.")
} else {
    print("You are a minor.")
}
### Switch Statements
Switch statements in Swift are powerful, supporting pattern matching and complex cases. Every switch statement must be exhaustive, meaning all possible cases are handled, including the default case if necessary.

let season = "Summer"
switch season {
case "Spring":
    print("It's spring!")
case "Summer":
    print("It's summer!")
case "Autumn":
    print("It's autumn!")
case "Winter":
    print("It's winter!")
default:
    print("Unknown season.")
}
### For Loops
Swift’s for loop iterates over collections, ranges, or any sequence.

for number in 1...5 {
    print(number)
}
### While Loops
Use while loops when the number of iterations is unknown. Swift offers both while and repeat-while loops.

var countdown = 3
while countdown > 0 {
    print(countdown)
    countdown -= 1
}
repeat-while guarantees at least one iteration, even if the condition is false initially.

repeat {
    print("Executing...")
} while false
## Additional Swift Syntax Features

### String Interpolation
String interpolation allows embedding variables and expressions directly in strings.

let name = "Alice"
let age = 30
let greeting = "Hello, \(name)! You are \(age) years old."
Optionals and Optional Binding
Swift’s optionals allow variables to hold a value or nil (no value). Use optional binding (if let or guard let) to safely unwrap optionals.

var userAge: Int? = 25
if let age = userAge {
    print("User's age is \(age).")
} else {
    print("Age not available.")
}

### Guard Statements
guard statements are used to exit a function early if conditions aren’t met, improving readability in functions with multiple conditions.

func greet(_ name: String?) {
    guard let name = name else {
        print("No name provided.")
        return
    }
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
## Summary

Understanding these core syntax elements provides the foundation for writing effective Swift code. Mastery of variables, constants, operators, and control flow structures enables the creation of expressive and efficient programs that leverage Swift’s unique strengths, whether you’re working on desktop apps or multi-platform solutions.
