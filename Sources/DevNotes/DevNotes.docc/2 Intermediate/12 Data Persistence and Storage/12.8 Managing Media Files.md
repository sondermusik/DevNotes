## Working with Images

### 1. **Storing Images Locally**
Swift's `FileManager` and `UIImage` or `NSImage` APIs enable seamless image storage.  
- **Steps to Save an Image:**  
  ```swift
  func saveImage(_ image: UIImage, withName name: String) throws {
      guard let data = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8) else {
          throw NSError(domain: "ImageConversionError", code: -1, userInfo: nil)
      }
      let url = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent("\(name).jpg")
      try data.write(to: url)
  }
Best Practices:
Use compression (e.g., JPEG quality settings) to save space.
Store thumbnails for quick access to previews.
2. Loading Images
Efficiently retrieve stored images to avoid UI performance issues.

func loadImage(named name: String) -> UIImage? {
    let url = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent("\(name).jpg")
    return UIImage(contentsOfFile: url.path)
}
3. Optimizing Image Performance
Use Core Graphics for image resizing and cropping.
Lazy-load images for scrolling views to avoid memory spikes.
Cache images using libraries like Kingfisher or SDWebImage.
Managing Audio Files

1. Storing Audio
Audio files are often stored in formats like MP3, AAC, or WAV. To save them locally, use FileManager:

func saveAudio(_ data: Data, withName name: String) throws {
    let url = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent("\(name).mp3")
    try data.write(to: url)
}
2. Playing Audio
The AVFoundation framework provides tools for playing audio.

Basic Playback with AVAudioPlayer:
func playAudio(named name: String) throws {
    let url = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent("\(name).mp3")
    let player = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url)
    player.play()
}
3. Optimizations for Audio Handling
Use streaming playback for large audio files.
Preload audio buffers for real-time performance in games or interactive apps.

    try data.write(to: url)
}
2. Playback with AVPlayer
The AVKit and AVFoundation frameworks simplify video playback.

Example Video Playback in SwiftUI:
import SwiftUI
import AVKit

struct VideoPlayerView: View {
    let videoURL: URL

    var body: some View {
        VideoPlayer(player: AVPlayer(url: videoURL))
            .frame(height: 200)
            .onAppear {
                let player = AVPlayer(url: videoURL)
                player.play()
            }
    }
}
3. Editing and Exporting Videos
Use AVAssetExportSession for video compression and format conversion.
Apply filters using Core Image or AVVideoComposition.

- **Audio/Video:** Use `AVAssetReader` for progressive playback of large files.  

### 3. **Batch Processing**  
- Process multiple files in parallel using Swift Concurrency:  
  ```swift
  Task {
      let images = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]
      await withTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
          for image in images {
              group.addTask {
                  await processImage(named: image)
              }
          }
      }
  }

public class MediaManager {
    public static func saveMedia(data: Data, to filename: String) throws {
        let url = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent(filename)
        try data.write(to: url)
    }
}
2. Platform-Specific Customizations
Use conditional compilation for platform-specific APIs:
#if os(iOS)
let thumbnail = UIImage(contentsOfFile: filePath)
#elseif os(macOS)
let thumbnail = NSImage(contentsOfFile: filePath)
#endif
3. File Format Standardization
Adopt formats like MP4 and JPEG for maximum cross-platform compatibility.
Convert platform-specific files (e.g., HEIC) into widely supported alternatives using ImageIO.
Optimizing Storage and Retrieval

Efficient storage and retrieval ensure minimal latency and resource usage for large media files.

1. Lazy Loading
Load media only when required to reduce memory overhead.

struct AsyncImageView: View {
    @StateObject private var loader = ImageLoader(url: "path/to/image")
    var body: some View {
        if let image = loader.image {
            Image(uiImage: image)
        } else {
            ProgressView()
        }
    }
}
2. Caching Strategies
Use NSCache for frequently accessed media.
Store processed thumbnails in a dedicated cache directory.

func encryptMedia(_ data: Data, with key: SymmetricKey) -> Data {
    return try! AES.GCM.seal(data, using: key).combined!
}

func decryptMedia(_ data: Data, with key: SymmetricKey) -> Data {
    let sealedBox = try! AES.GCM.SealedBox(combined: data)
    return try! AES.GCM.open(sealedBox, using: key)
}
2. Scoped File Access
Use security-scoped bookmarks for sandboxed access on macOS and iOS.
Example: Granting user-specific file access:
let bookmark = try url.bookmarkData()
let securedURL = try URL(resolvingBookmarkData: bookmark, bookmarkDataIsStale: nil)
3. Compliance with Privacy Laws
Provide mechanisms for users to delete stored files.
Encrypt locally stored user-generated content to comply with GDPR/CCPA.
