# 1 Introduction to Concurrency in Swift

An introduction to concurrency in Swift, 
covering how multitasking enables responsive,
efficient applications by allowing tasks to run 
independently and potentially in parallel.

## 1.1 What is Concurrency?

Concurrency in programming allows a computer 
to manage multiple tasks simultaneously, 
enhancing multitasking and overall app performance. 
In Swift, concurrency enables responsive, 
high-performance apps by letting tasks run independently and, 
when feasible, in parallel.

Swift’s concurrency tools, such as `async/await` and `Task`, 
divide complex operations into smaller, manageable units. 
This improves the efficiency of long-running tasks, 
especially in modern apps where smooth and continuous 
user interactions are essential.

## 1.2 Serial vs. Concurrent

### Serial Execution

**Serial execution** is when tasks run one after another, in a strict sequence.

Managed by a serial queue, each task must complete before the next starts,
ensuring an ordered progression.
This execution style is useful for tasks that
depend on each other or require controlled access to shared resources.

#### Example:

```swift
let serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.serialQueue")

serialQueue.async {
    print("Task 1")
}
serialQueue.async {
    print("Task 2") // Runs after Task 1 completes.
}
```

### Concurrent Execution

**Concurrent execution** allows tasks to start 
and progress simultaneously when resources permit. 

Swift’s concurrency model supports concurrent execution to efficiently handle independent tasks that don’t depend on each other, reducing processing time.

#### Example:

```swift
let concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.concurrentQueue", attributes: .concurrent)

concurrentQueue.async {
    print("Concurrent Task 1")
}
concurrentQueue.async {
    print("Concurrent Task 2") // May run in parallel with Task 1
}
```

## 1.3 Concurrency vs. Parallelism

### Concurrency
Refers to managing multiple tasks so they make progress independently, 
often by starting, stopping, and resuming tasks as resources allow. 
In Swift, concurrency allows the system to organize tasks efficiently 
without them blocking each other, even if they aren’t running simultaneously.

### Parallelism
Is a specific type of concurrency where multiple tasks run at the same time, 
but it requires multiple CPU cores to achieve true simultaneous execution. 
Swift’s runtime leverages parallelism when tasks are independent and multiple cores are available,
resulting in faster processing for certain workloads.

### Key Distinctions:
**Concurrency** is a broad concept about handling multiple tasks effectively, 
with or without simultaneous execution.
**Parallelism** is a form of concurrency where tasks run at the same time on separate CPU cores,
maximizing resource usage.

## 1.4 Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

### Synchronous Execution
In synchronous execution, tasks run sequentially, 
each waiting for the previous one to finish.
This approach is predictable but may block the main thread, 
potentially causing the app to feel sluggish.

### Asynchronous Execution
Enables tasks to run independently, finishing as resources allow. 
This approach is essential for long-running tasks, 
like network calls or file processing, 
that would otherwise block the main thread.

## 1.5 Why Concurrency Matters

Swift’s concurrency capabilities improve performance by utilizing CPU cores, 
enhancing responsiveness, and maximizing resource usage. 
With concurrency, intensive tasks like media processing can run in the background 
while the UI remains responsive.

### Responsiveness
Concurrency offloads background tasks, preventing main-thread blocking 
and ensuring a fluid user experience. 
By assigning tasks to background threads, 
apps can handle multiple operations without affecting UI performance.

### Efficient Resource Usage
Concurrency balances work across available CPU cores, 
minimizing memory usage and reducing battery drain. 
It enables an app to leverage the system’s resources fully, 
without overloading any single core.

## 1.6 Key Insights

### Managing Tasks Effectively
Concurrency isn’t merely about running tasks simultaneously; it’s about managing them effectively. Swift’s DispatchQueue, Task, and async/await help balance task execution, avoiding conflicts and ensuring data consistency.

### Challenges in Concurrency
Concurrency introduces complexities like race conditions, deadlocks, and priority inversion. Swift’s structured concurrency model mitigates these risks by enforcing task order, isolating state, and automating memory management.

### Concurrency Balances Speed and Responsiveness
Concurrency in Swift separates background work from user interaction. With the main thread focused on UI tasks and background threads on intensive operations, Swift’s concurrency model enhances app responsiveness.

### Practical Use of Concurrency in Business Logic
Concurrency is often applied in the business logic layer, where tasks like network requests or data processing benefit from background execution. This prevents the UI layer from slowing down, keeping the app responsive.
