3.3 Functional Programming Basics

A guide to understanding functional programming principles and techniques in Swift.

Introduction

Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes functions, immutability, and avoiding shared state. Swift supports functional programming features, which can help developers write code that’s more concise, predictable, and easier to test. While Swift is not a purely functional language, it offers a rich toolkit of functional concepts that are well-suited to high-performance, modern development.

In this article, we’ll cover the basics of functional programming in Swift, including higher-order functions, immutability, and how FP concepts can complement Swift’s object-oriented features.

What is Functional Programming?

Functional programming is a way of writing code where functions are treated as the primary building blocks. Key aspects include:

Pure Functions: Functions that, given the same inputs, always return the same outputs and have no side effects.
Immutability: The practice of not modifying values or data once created.
First-Class Functions: Functions are treated as values, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as parameters, and returned from other functions.
Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
Together, these features help create predictable, easy-to-read code that can reduce bugs and make concurrency safer by minimizing shared mutable state.

Core Functional Techniques in Swift

Higher-Order Functions: map, filter, and reduce
Higher-order functions allow you to perform common operations on collections like arrays, dictionaries, and sets without explicitly writing loops. The most frequently used higher-order functions in Swift are map, filter, and reduce.

Map: Transforms each element in a collection and returns a new collection with the transformed values.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let doubled = numbers.map { $0 * 2 }
// Result: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Filter: Returns a new collection containing only elements that meet a specified condition.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
// Result: [2, 4]
Reduce: Combines all elements in a collection to produce a single value.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let sum = numbers.reduce(0, +)
// Result: 15
These functions allow you to write clear and concise code that’s easy to reason about, without manually iterating over collections.

Immutability
Immutability in functional programming helps make code more predictable. By default, Swift constants (let) cannot be changed after they are assigned. Swift also has built-in methods like .map, .filter, and .reduce that return new collections instead of modifying existing ones, supporting immutability.

Benefits of Immutability:
Predictability: With immutable data, the state cannot change unexpectedly.
Concurrency: Immutability reduces the risk of bugs in concurrent code by eliminating shared mutable state.
Example of Immutability

let originalArray = [1, 2, 3]
let newArray = originalArray.map { $0 * 2 }
// originalArray remains [1, 2, 3]; newArray is [2, 4, 6]
Pure Functions
A pure function is a function where the output is determined solely by its input values, without observable side effects like modifying global state or producing I/O.

Example of a Pure Function

func add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}
Pure functions are easier to test and reason about since they don’t depend on or alter external state.

Closures
Closures in Swift are blocks of code that capture the surrounding context. Swift’s closures can be thought of as “anonymous functions” and are heavily used in functional programming, especially with higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce.

Example of a Closure

let multiply = { (a: Int, b: Int) -> Int in
    return a * b
}
print(multiply(3, 4)) // Output: 12
Combining Functional and Object-Oriented Programming in Swift

Swift supports both object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP). Here’s how they can be combined effectively:

Using Functional Techniques in Class Methods: Classes can use functional patterns to process data without altering the state.
class MathOperations {
    func squareEach(_ numbers: [Int]) -> [Int] {
        return numbers.map { $0 * $0 }
    }
}
Structs and Immutability: Swift structs are value types, meaning they are copied on assignment. This aligns well with FP’s immutability principle.
struct Rectangle {
    var width: Double
    var height: Double
    
    func area() -> Double {
        return width * height
    }
}
Protocols for Abstractions: Protocols can define functional requirements, allowing types to conform to specific behaviors without inheriting state, making code flexible and reducing coupling.
protocol Mappable {
    func map<T>(_ transform: (Self) -> T) -> T
}
By blending FP techniques with OOP structures, Swift allows you to write code that leverages the best of both paradigms, supporting efficient and expressive solutions.

Summary

Functional programming in Swift, while optional, brings powerful techniques that can make code simpler, safer, and more predictable. The use of higher-order functions, immutability, pure functions, and closures lets developers build clean, concise code that’s easier to debug and test. With Swift’s ability to blend functional and object-oriented paradigms, you can achieve the clarity of FP alongside the structural benefits of OOP—ideal for creating high-performance, cross-platform applications in Swift 6.
