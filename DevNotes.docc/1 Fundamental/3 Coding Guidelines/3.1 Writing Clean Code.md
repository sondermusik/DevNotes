# 3.1 Writing Clean Code

_Essential practices for writing code that’s easy to understand, maintain, and extend._

---

## Why Clean Code Matters

Writing clean, readable code is essential for building 
high-quality software that’s maintainable and easy to understand. 
For anyone working with your codebase—whether it’s teammates or future you—
clarity in code structure and intention saves time and reduces bugs. 
It’s not just about making code that works; 
it’s about making code that can be easily 
understood, debugged, and improved over time.

Following best practices ensures that your code remains reliable 
and adaptable as your application evolves or scales.

---

## Key Practices for Writing Clean, Readable Code

### 1. Use Descriptive Naming Conventions

Good naming is the first step in writing clean code. 
Choose names that make the purpose of each variable, function, or class immediately clear.

- **Variables and Constants**:  
    - Use names that describe what the data represents
    - Avoid generic names like `data` or `value`
    - Go for `userProfile`, `itemCount`, or `selectedColor` instead

- **Functions**:  
    - Name functions after the action they perform
    - Use descriptive names like `fetchUserData()` or `calculateTotalPrice()`

- **Classes and Structs**: 
    - Name these after the entities they represent
    - For example `User`, `Order`, or `ProductCatalog`

- Tip: camelCase for variables and functions  
PascalCase for classes and structs

### 2. Structure and Format Code Consistently

Swift enforces a fair amount of formatting by design, 
but you should still follow a consistent style throughout your codebase. 
Consistent formatting makes code easier to read and navigate.

- **Indentation and Spacing**
    - Use consistent indentation (Xcode uses 4 spaces by default)
    - Add line breaks between logical sections to improve readability
- **Brace Style**
    - Place opening braces on the same line as declarations
    ```swift
    if condition {
        // Do something
    }
    ```
- **Grouping**: 
    - Group related functions and properties together
    - Use "`// MARK: -`" to add headers in longer files

### 3. Follow DRY Principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself

The DRY principle aims to reduce redundancy by avoiding duplicated code. 
Repeating code can lead to inconsistencies and harder-to-maintain code.

- **Reusable Functions**  
    If you find the same code snippet appearing multiple times, 
    consider moving it into a reusable function.

- **Constants**  
    Store commonly used values, like color hex codes or margin sizes, in constants. 
    This way, you only need to update them in one place if they change.

- **Swift Protocols**
    Use protocols to define shared behavior between classes, structs, or enums, 
    reducing the need for duplicated code.

### 4. Keep It Simple (KISS)

Complex code is harder to debug, read, and maintain. 
The KISS principle (“Keep It Simple, Stupid”) encourages straightforward, simple solutions.

- **Break Down Logic**
    Avoid writing functions that try to do too much. 
    Each function should have a single, clear responsibility.

- **Avoid Clever Code**: 
    Write code that is easy to understand. 
    Code that requires a “trick” or deep Swift knowledge to interpret should be rethought.

### 5. Modularize Your Code

Divide your code into modules, functions, and classes that each handle a distinct task.
Modularity makes it easier to understand individual parts of the code 
and test them independently.

- **Functions**  
    Each function should handle a single task. 
    If it’s doing too much, break it down into smaller functions.

- **Classes and Structs**
    Each class or struct should represent a single concept. 
    For example, if you have a `User` class, it shouldn’t also handle file I/O; 
    that’s another class’s job.


### 6. Use Swift’s Built-In Functional Tools

Swift offers built-in higher-order functions 
like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to help you write concise, readable code.

- **Map**: Use `map` to transform elements in a collection.
- **Filter**: Use `filter` to select elements that match a specific condition.
- **Reduce**: Use `reduce` to combine all elements into a single result.

#### Example of clean, functional code:
```swift
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
let squaredNumbers = evenNumbers.map { $0 * $0 }
let sumOfSquares = squaredNumbers.reduce(0, +)
```

### 7. Keep Functions and Methods Short
Long functions are often hard to understand and debug. 
Aim to keep functions under 20 lines when possible. 
Short functions that do one thing well are easier to read and test.

**Extract Logic**:  
    If a function is growing too long, extract parts of the logic into helper functions.

**Use Guard Statements**: 
    Guard statements allow you to handle error cases early, 
    making the rest of the function more readable.

#### Example:
```swift
func fetchUser(id: Int) -> User? {
    guard id > 0 else { return nil }
    // Fetch user logic here
}
```

### 8. Add Comments Sparingly
Comments can be helpful for explaining complex code, but avoid over-commenting. 
Instead of explaining what code does, focus on writing code that’s self-explanatory.

#### Explain Why, Not What 
Comments should clarify the intent or reasoning behind complex logic, 
not restate what the code already does.

#### Use Documentation Comments
Use /// to create Swift’s documentation comments for functions, classes, and structs. 
This helps generate documentation automatically in Xcode.

#### Example:
```swift
/// Fetches the profile data for the given user ID
func fetchProfileData(for userId: Int) -> Profile? {
    // Detailed logic here
}
```
### 9. Be Consistent with Error Handling

#### Handle Errors Consistently and Gracefully
In Swift development, "graceful error handling" means managing errors in a way 
that prevents app crashes and ensures the user receives clear feedback on what went wrong. 
Graceful handling also minimizes disruption and ideally offers a way 
for users to resolve or recover from the issue. 

For example, if network data fails to load, 
a graceful approach might be to show a "Retry" option 
rather than simply displaying a vague error or, worse, letting the app crash.

Error handling should be consistent across your codebase, 
especially in production-grade applications 
where poor error handling can degrade the user experience. 
Swift offers tools for error handling that allow us 
to catch, display, and handle errors with flexibility.

#### Error Handling Strategies

1. **Use `guard` and `try?` for Early Exits**  
Swift’s `guard` statement helps with early exits, 
allowing you to quickly handle failure conditions 
and exit a function if something goes wrong. 
Combining `guard` with `try?` provides a safe way 
to handle operations that might fail, such as file or network requests, 
by returning `nil` instead of throwing an error.

2. **Provide Meaningful Error Messages**  
When errors occur, provide detailed messages 
that help the user understand what went wrong and, if possible, how to proceed. 
Error messages should be user-friendly and avoid technical jargon. 
For internal logging, error messages can be more detailed to assist with debugging.

3. **Return Errors or Log Errors Immediately?**  
Deciding whether to additional return errors through a completion handler 
or to handle them immediately depends on the context:

    - **Return Errors to Completion Handlers**  
        This is ideal when you want the caller (parent function)
        to decide how to handle the error. 
        For example, in complex workflows or asynchronous operations, 
        passing the error up allows different parts of the app 
        to handle errors based on their specific needs.

   - **Log Errors Directly**  
        If an error doesn’t need to be handled further up in the chain 
        (e.g., a network request fails but the app can continue without it), 
        logging the error immediately may be the best approach. 
        Log messages should be detailed enough for debugging 
        but should not overwhelm the user interface.

#### Examples of Error Handling

Here’s an example to illustrate both the use of `guard`, `try?`, 
and a decision about when to pass errors up versus logging them directly.

##### Example 1: Handling Errors with `try?` and Guard for Optional Results

In this example, `loadUserData` uses `try?` and `guard` 
to handle errors gracefully without passing errors back up the chain. 
Here, the function logs an error if data isn’t found but returns `nil`, 
allowing the caller to respond based on the availability of the user data.

```swift
enum UserError: Error {
    case dataNotFound
    case decodingError
}

func loadUserData() -> User? {
    guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf: userFile) else {
        print("Error: User data not found.")
        return nil
    }
    
    // Attempt to decode user data
    guard let user = try? JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data) else {
        print("Error: Failed to decode user data.")
        return nil
    }
    return user
}
```
This approach is suitable for cases where data failure is not critical. 
We log errors directly, so no error handling is required from the calling code.

##### Example 2: Using Completion Handlers to Return Errors for Caller Handling

In scenarios where an error needs to be managed by the caller, 
such as in complex workflows, you can use completion handlers to pass errors up. 
Here, the caller can provide specific responses, 
like retrying, showing an alert, or performing a fallback action.

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case invalidURL
    case requestFailed
}

func fetchUserData(url: String, completion: @escaping (Result<User, NetworkError>) -> Void) {
    guard let requestURL = URL(string: url) else {
        completion(.failure(.invalidURL))
        return
    }
    
    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: requestURL) { data, response, error in
        if error != nil {
            completion(.failure(.requestFailed))
            return
        }
        
        guard let data = data, let user = try? JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data) else {
            completion(.failure(.requestFailed))
            return
        }
        
        completion(.success(user))
    }.resume()
}
```

The completion handler here returns an error if the operation fails. 
This allows the caller to handle each error case with specific responses, 
such as prompting the user to retry or showing a detailed error message.

##### Example 3: Logging Errors for Internal Use

Sometimes, you may only need to log an error without notifying the user. 
This approach is often used in background tasks or optional operations 
where failure does not need to interrupt the user experience.

```swift
func updateAnalytics() {
    do {
        try performAnalyticsUpdate()
    } catch {
        print("Analytics update failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
In this case, an error during analytics updating is logged but does not impact the app’s primary functionality. This keeps the code clean and unobtrusive to the user.

#### Error Handling Summary

##### Graceful Handling
Design error handling to minimize app crashes and provide user-friendly feedback. 
When possible, offer options like retries rather than simply displaying error alerts.

##### Use guard and try? for Safe Unwrapping
Use try? and guard to safely unwrap optionals 
without forcing the caller to manage every possible error.

##### Choose Between Immediate Logging or Passing Errors Up
Immediate Logging: For non-critical errors where user interruption isn’t necessary, 
log errors and continue.
Completion Handlers: For important errors where specific actions are needed, 
pass errors up through completion handlers so that the caller has full control.
By following these practices, you create error handling that’s consistent, 
informative, and aligned with Swift’s emphasis on safety and clarity.

### 10. Avoid Global State and Side Effects
#### What Are Side Effects?

In programming, a “side effect” occurs when a function or method changes a state 
outside its scope, such as modifying global variables, altering database records, 
or updating UI elements directly. 

Global state and hidden side effects often lead to unpredictable, hard-to-maintain code.

Functions that avoid side effects are called pure functions.
They make code more predictable and easier to test.

#### Why Avoid Global State and Side Effects?
Here’s a closer look at why global state can be problematic

##### Difficult to Track
Changes in global variables can occur from any part of the code, 
making it hard to pinpoint where and when a variable's value was modified.

##### Unpredictable Behavior
Because global variables can be altered from anywhere, 
they introduce unpredictable behavior, especially in larger applications.

##### Testing Challenges
Global state often makes it difficult to write reliable unit tests 
because the global state can affect tests that are otherwise independent.


#### Example: Avoiding Side Effects
Here’s an example of a function that does cause side effects by modifying an external variable:
```swift
var globalCounter = 0

func incrementCounter() {
    globalCounter += 1 // Modifying an external variable
}

// Instead, we can avoid side effects:
// - by passing the counter as an argument 
// - and returning the updated value:

func incrementCounter(_ counter: Int) -> Int {
    return counter + 1
}

let newCounter = incrementCounter(globalCounter)
```

### Encapsulate State

Encapsulation means keeping state within a defined boundary 
(e.g., within a class or struct) rather than exposing it to the global scope. 
By making properties private, you restrict external access and modification, 
enforcing more controlled, predictable state changes.

#### Example of Encapsulated State

Consider a scenario where you want to track a user’s score in a game:
```swift
class GameScore {
    // Private properties encapsulate state within the class
    private var score = 0

    func increaseScore(by points: Int) {
        score += points
    }

    func getScore() -> Int {
        return score
    }
}
```

##### In this case:

- The score variable is private, meaning only GameScore can modify it.
- External code can only interact with score through methods that the class provides, 
which helps prevent unintended modifications and makes testing easier.


### Avoid Singleton Overuse

Singletons are sometimes necessary, but overusing them can lead to hidden dependencies
and tight coupling between parts of the code. 
When you access a singleton instance from anywhere in the code, 
you’re essentially introducing global state, which makes code harder to test and refactor.

#### Example Singleton (Avoid)

Here’s an example of a singleton to handle user settings:
```swift
class UserSettings {
    static let shared = UserSettings() // Singleton instance
    private init() {} // Prevent external instantiation

    var darkModeEnabled = false
}
```
##### In this example:

- Any part of the code can access and modify UserSettings.shared.darkModeEnabled, 
which creates a global state.

- It’s challenging to test different settings independently 
because they’re tied to a single global instance.

##### Replacing a Singleton with Dependency Injection

Instead of a singleton, consider using dependency injection. 
This approach allows you to pass instances of UserSettings into components that need it, reducing global state and improving testability.

#### Refactored Example with Dependency Injection

In this version, we inject UserSettings into other classes as needed, 
instead of relying on a singleton.
```swift
// Define a Protocol for UserSettings if you want to make it more flexible (e.g., for testing)
protocol UserSettingsProtocol {
    var darkModeEnabled: Bool { get set }
}

// Implement the Protocol in the UserSettings class.
class UserSettings: UserSettingsProtocol {
    var darkModeEnabled = false
}

// Inject UserSettings Dependency where needed. 
// For example, let’s say you have a SettingsViewController that needs access to UserSettings.
class SettingsViewController {
    private let userSettings: UserSettingsProtocol

    // Inject UserSettings dependency through initializer
    init(userSettings: UserSettingsProtocol) {
        self.userSettings = userSettings
    }

    func toggleDarkMode() {
        userSettings.darkModeEnabled.toggle()
    }
}
```
#### Initialize with a specific instance. 
Instead of directly referencing UserSettings.shared, you pass an instance of UserSettings.
```swift
let userSettings = UserSettings()
let settingsVC = SettingsViewController(userSettings: userSettings)
settingsVC.toggleDarkMode()
```
##### In this approach:

Flexibility
You can easily replace UserSettings with a mock 
or different implementation for testing purposes.

Testability: 
Testing SettingsViewController is easier because you control the instance of UserSettings 
and can inject different configurations as needed.

Reduced Global State: 
UserSettings is no longer accessed globally, 
avoiding the issues that arise from having shared mutable state across the application.

#### Summary
Avoiding global state and hidden side effects 
helps maintain clean, testable, and modular code. 
By encapsulating state within classes and using dependency injection instead of singletons,
you make your code more predictable and easier to understand, debug, and extend. 
These practices are particularly valuable in large, high-performance applications 
where clarity and maintainability are essential.

This approach makes it easier to handle different network conditions 
without having to rely on arbitrary constants or unclear flags.

### 11. When to Use Optionals and How to Avoid Overusing Them

Optionals are a powerful feature in Swift, allowing us to handle the absence of values safely.
However, using them excessively or in the wrong context 
can lead to complexity and potential issues in your code. 
Let’s explore when it’s appropriate to use optionals 
and when you can avoid them to keep your code cleaner and more predictable.

#### What Are Optionals?
In Swift, an optional is a variable that can hold either a value or `nil` (no value). 
They’re particularly useful for representing values that might be missing or uninitialized,
such as user input, network responses, or values that depend on external conditions.

```swift
var name: String? // This can hold a String or be nil
```

#### Why Not Always Use Optionals?

While optionals are useful, overusing them can introduce unnecessary complexity:

##### More Code to Handle Nil Values: 
Optionals require additional code to handle unwrapping, 
which can make simple operations cumbersome.
##### Increased Risk of Errors:
Optionals that aren’t properly handled can lead to runtime crashes if force-unwrapped (!).
Readability and Maintainability: 
Excessive optional handling (e.g., through optional chaining or guard statements) can make code harder to read and maintain.

#### When to Use Optionals
Optionals should be used in situations 
where the absence of a value is a valid and expected scenario:

##### Uninitialized State 
Use optionals when a value cannot be initialized 
at the time of declaration but may be set later.
```swift
class UserProfile {
    var profileImage: UIImage? // Image might not be available immediately
}
```

##### Parsing External Data
When working with data from APIs, JSON, or other external sources, 
optionals help safely handle missing or null values.
struct User: Decodable {
    let email: String? // Email might be missing from some responses
}
##### User Input: User input that may or may not be provided, like an optional text field in a form, is another good use case for optionals.
var nickname: String? // User might skip entering a nickname
##### Delayed Initialization in Classes: Optionals are useful for properties that must be nil initially but will be assigned a value later.
class ImageLoader {
    var loadedImage: UIImage?
    
    func load() {
        loadedImage = UIImage(named: "example")
    }
}
##### Weak References in ARC (Automatic Reference Counting): In ARC, optional weak references (weak var) allow a property to be deallocated when it’s no longer needed.
class ViewController {
    weak var delegate: SomeDelegate?
}


#### When to Avoid Optionals and Use Default Values Instead
There are cases where optionals can be avoided by using default values or other approaches:

##### Non-Optional Default Values: If an optional has a common default value, use that instead.
var itemCount: Int = 0 // No need for itemCount to be optional if 0 is a valid initial value
##### Empty Collections Instead of Optionals: For arrays, dictionaries, or sets, prefer an empty collection over an optional.
var items: [String] = [] // Use an empty array instead of making it optional
##### Using nil Coalescing Operator (??) for Default Values: When optionals are necessary but you have a default fallback, use the nil-coalescing operator to provide a value if the optional is nil.
let displayName = nickname ?? "Guest" // Provides a default if nickname is nil
##### Avoid Optionals for Constant Values: If a value is always present or can be assigned an initial value, make it non-optional. For example:
let userName: String = "Default User" // Since it’s constant, avoid using optional
##### Early Unwrapping to Simplify Code: If you’re confident an optional has a value and need it in a controlled scope, use guard or if let to unwrap it early and handle the nil case gracefully.
func processUser(_ user: User?) {
    guard let user = user else {
        print("User is nil")
        return
    }
    // Now `user` is non-optional within this scope
    print(user.name)
}

#### Safe Use of Optionals Without Error Handling
In certain cases, optionals can be used in a way that avoids heavy error handling:

##### Optional Chaining for Safe Access: Optional chaining allows you to access properties and methods on an optional that may be nil without crashing the program. If any link in the chain is nil, the entire chain returns nil.
let userProfileImage = user?.profile?.image
##### Nil-Coalescing for Defaults: Use ?? to provide a fallback value directly within expressions without requiring explicit error handling.
let age = user?.age ?? 18 // Defaults to 18 if `age` is nil
##### Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals
For properties that will definitely have a value after initial setup 
(such as properties set in viewDidLoad in view controllers), 
use Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals (Type!).
Be cautious with these as they can still lead to runtime errors if accessed before being set.
class UserProfileViewController: UIViewController {
    var userID: String!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        userID = "user123" // Must be set before accessing elsewhere
    }
}

#### Summary
Optionals are a helpful feature in Swift for handling potentially missing values safely. However, they should be used thoughtfully:

- Use Optionals where the absence of a value is meaningful or expected.

- Avoid Overusing Optionals by defaulting to non-optional types 
with initial values where possible, especially for collections and constants.

- Handle Optionals Cleanly by unwrapping early, using default values, 
and applying optional chaining and nil-coalescing operators for concise, readable code.


## Summary

Clean, readable code is essential for building maintainable and high-performance apps.
By using descriptive naming, following formatting conventions, keeping code simple, 
and embracing modularity, you create code that is easier to read, test, and extend. 
With these practices in place, you’re setting up your project—and team—
for long-term success and a smoother development process.
