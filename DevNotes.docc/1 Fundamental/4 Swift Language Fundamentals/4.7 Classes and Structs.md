# 4.7 Classes and Structs

_An in-depth exploration of classes and structs in Swift, including their differences, use cases, and best practices for high-performance development._

---

## Overview

Classes and structs are fundamental building blocks in Swift, each providing distinct capabilities for organizing and managing data. Understanding their differences, advantages, and scenarios for usage is critical for writing efficient and maintainable code. This article explains their core features, compares value vs. reference semantics, and offers best practices to choose between them.

## What Are Classes and Structs?

In Swift, **classes** and **structs** are used to define custom data types. Both allow you to encapsulate properties and methods that operate on those properties, but they differ significantly in how they behave and are used.

### Declaring a Class
A class is a reference type, meaning it is passed by reference and supports inheritance.

```swift
class Vehicle {
    var speed: Int = 0
    func drive() {
        print("Driving at \(speed) km/h")
    }
}
Declaring a Struct
A struct is a value type, meaning it is passed by value and does not support inheritance.

struct Car {
    var speed: Int = 0
    func drive() {
        print("Driving at \(speed) km/h")
    }
}
Key Differences Between Classes and Structs

| Feature                          | Classes                     | Structs                    |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Memory Management**            | Reference type (shared)     | Value type (copied)        |
| **Inheritance**                  | Supported                   | Not supported              |
| **Initialization**               | Custom initializers required for stored properties without default values | Automatic memberwise initializers |
| **Mutability**                   | Controlled by `var`/`let` at property level | Controlled by `var`/`let` at instance level |
| **Performance**                  | Potentially slower due to reference counting (ARC) | Faster for small data due to value copying |
| **Identity**                     | Supports identity checks with `===` | Does not support identity checks |
| **Deinitializers**               | Supported                   | Not supported              |

Reference Types vs. Value Types

Reference Types (Classes)
Shared Instance: Multiple variables can reference the same object.
ARC (Automatic Reference Counting): Swift uses ARC to manage memory for classes, which can introduce overhead.
Identity: Classes have unique identity and can be compared using the === operator.
let car1 = Vehicle()
let car2 = car1
car2.speed = 60
print(car1.speed) // Output: 60 (shared instance)
Value Types (Structs)
Copied Instance: Each variable holds an independent copy of the data.
No ARC Overhead: Structs are allocated on the stack and copied when passed.
Immutable by Default: If declared with let, the entire instance is immutable.
var car1 = Car(speed: 50)
var car2 = car1
car2.speed = 80
print(car1.speed) // Output: 50 (independent copy)
Choosing Between Classes and Structs

Use Classes When:
Reference Semantics Are Needed:
You want to share state between multiple objects (e.g., a singleton or manager).
Inheritance Is Required:
When creating a hierarchy of types.
ARC Benefits Outweigh Overheads:
When managing large datasets or objects requiring controlled memory sharing.
Use Structs When:
Value Semantics Are Desired:
Each copy should be independent.
Small, Lightweight Models:
Ideal for models like coordinates, sizes, or durations.
Thread Safety:
Value types are inherently safer in concurrent programming.
Features and Enhancements in Swift 6 (2024)

Structs
Move Semantics: Optimized memory handling for structs, reducing unnecessary copies during assignment.
Enhanced Pattern Matching: Support for exhaustive matching in enums and structs.
Classes
Memory Optimizations: Reduced ARC overhead in common use cases.
Distributed Actor Integration: Enhanced support for distributed computing with class-like distributed actors.
Best Practices

For Structs
Use Mutating Methods Wisely:
Mutating methods enable changes to properties of a struct instance.
struct Counter {
    var count = 0
    mutating func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
}
Avoid Excessive Copying:
Be mindful of struct size; large structs with heavy copying can degrade performance.
Leverage Memberwise Initializers:
Swift provides default memberwise initializers for structs.
struct Point {
    var x: Double
    var y: Double
}
let point = Point(x: 0.0, y: 0.0)
For Classes
Minimize ARC Overhead:
Avoid strong reference cycles with weak or unowned references.
class Person {
    var name: String
    weak var friend: Person?
    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
}
Use Protocols for Shared Behavior:
Prefer protocols over inheritance for shared functionality.
Consider Final Classes:
Mark a class as final if you don’t intend it to be subclassed. This can improve performance.
final class Animal {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
}
Advanced Topics

Protocol Conformance
Both classes and structs can conform to protocols, enabling polymorphism.

protocol Drivable {
    func drive()
}

class Truck: Drivable {
    func drive() {
        print("Truck is driving")
    }
}

struct Bicycle: Drivable {
    func drive() {
        print("Bicycle is driving")
    }
}
Immutability in Structs
By default, structs are immutable when declared with let. Use var for mutability.

let bike = Bicycle()
bike.drive() // Allowed because method doesn't mutate the struct
Codable Conformance
Both structs and classes can conform to Codable for serialization.

struct User: Codable {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}

let jsonData = try JSONEncoder().encode(User(name: "Alice", age: 30))
let decodedUser = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: jsonData)
Common Pitfalls

Overusing Classes:
Avoid classes for simple, immutable data models.
Neglecting Copy-on-Write Semantics in Structs:
Ensure large structs use efficient copying mechanisms when shared.
Ignoring Reference Cycles:
Always analyze reference ownership in complex class hierarchies.
Summary

Understanding the differences between classes and structs is essential for writing efficient, clean, and scalable Swift code. Use classes for shared state and inheritance, while structs are best for lightweight, immutable data. By following Swift’s best practices and leveraging modern enhancements, you can create robust applications that perform well across platforms.
