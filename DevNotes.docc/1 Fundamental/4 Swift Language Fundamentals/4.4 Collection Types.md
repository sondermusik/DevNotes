# 4.4 Value Types
_A guide to essential Swift collection types and value types

---

## Value Types
Value types hold their data directly and include basic types like 
- `Int`
- `Double`
- `String`
- `Bool`
- collection types

These are copied when assigned or passed around, which enhances safety and predictability.

Int: Represents integer values, such as Int, Int32, and UInt8.
Double: Represents floating-point numbers with different precision levels. Double is preferred over Float due to its higher precision.
String: A sequence of characters, represented by the String type, optimized for performance and Unicode compliance.
Bool: Represents Boolean binary values, true or false, 0 or 1.

## Collection Types

### Arrays
An array is an ordered collection of elements.
In Swift, arrays are highly optimized for performance and can hold any type,
including both value types and reference types.

#### Initialization
You can create an empty array with specific types or directly populate it with elements.
  
```swift
var intArray: [Int] = []          // Empty array of integers
var stringArray = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
```

#### Accessing Elements
Arrays allow indexed access.
```swift
let firstItem = stringArray[0]     // "Apple"
```

#### Mutability
Use var to create a mutable array or let to make it immutable.

#### Common Methods:

- **append(_:)**  
Add a new element to the end.

- **insert(_:at:)**  
Insert an element at a specific position.

- **remove(at:)**   
Remove an element at a specified index.

```swift
stringArray.append("Date")
stringArray.remove(at: 1)        // Removes "Banana"
```

### Dictionaries
A dictionary is an unordered collection that stores key-value pairs.
It’s ideal for fast lookups and mappings of unique keys to values.

#### Initialization:
```swift
var studentGrades: [String: Double] = ["Alice": 88.5, "Bob": 92.0]
```

#### Accessing Values
Access values via keys. Returns an optional since the key might not exist.
let aliceGrade = studentGrades["Alice"]  // 88.5
#### Updating Values:
studentGrades["Alice"] = 90.0
studentGrades["Charlie"] = 85.5          // Adds a new entry
#### Removing Elements:
studentGrades.removeValue(forKey: "Bob")

### Sets
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are particularly useful when you need to ensure there are no duplicate items, or for membership testing and mathematical set operations.

Initialization:
var uniqueNames: Set<String> = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
Operations: Sets support common mathematical operations.
union(_:): Combines two sets.
intersection(_:): Keeps only elements that are common in both sets.
subtracting(_:): Removes elements found in another set.
let additionalNames: Set<String> = ["Alice", "David"]
let allNames = uniqueNames.union(additionalNames)       // {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"}
Collection Methods: map, filter, and reduce

Swift’s functional programming tools (map, filter, and reduce) allow for powerful, concise data transformations on collections.

map(_:)
map transforms each element in a collection and returns an array of the transformed elements.

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let squaredNumbers = numbers.map { $0 * $0 }  // [1, 4, 9, 16]
filter(_:)
filter returns an array containing only the elements that match a specified condition.

let evenNumbers = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }  // [2, 4]
reduce(::)
reduce combines all elements in a collection into a single result, starting from an initial value.

let sum = numbers.reduce(0, +)  // 10
