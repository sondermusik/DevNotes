# 4.3 Common Protocols

A guide to Swift’s core protocols, which provide powerful, reusable functionality across types.

Introduction

Protocols in Swift define a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements for functionality that can be adopted by classes, structs, and enums. This approach allows developers to define common functionality across diverse types, supporting cleaner, modular, and more maintainable code. In this article, we'll cover essential protocols like Equatable, Comparable, Codable, Identifiable, and CustomStringConvertible, which offer foundational capabilities for comparison, serialization, and identity management.

1. Equatable
The Equatable protocol allows types to be compared for equality, enabling the == and != operators. This protocol is fundamental for working with collections, filtering, and search functions.

Requirements

The only requirement for conforming to Equatable is implementing the == operator, allowing you to specify custom equality logic.

Example

struct Person: Equatable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    
    static func == (lhs: Person, rhs: Person) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name == rhs.name && lhs.age == rhs.age
    }
}

let person1 = Person(name: "Alice", age: 30)
let person2 = Person(name: "Alice", age: 30)

print(person1 == person2) // true
2. Comparable
Comparable extends Equatable and enables types to be compared in terms of ordering with the <, <=, >, and >= operators. Implementing this protocol is particularly useful for sorting and arranging custom types.

Requirements

To conform to Comparable, define the < operator. Swift infers the other operators (<=, >, and >=) based on this implementation.

Example

struct Product: Comparable {
    let name: String
    let price: Double
    
    static func < (lhs: Product, rhs: Product) -> Bool {
        return lhs.price < rhs.price
    }
}

let products = [
    Product(name: "Product A", price: 9.99),
    Product(name: "Product B", price: 4.99),
    Product(name: "Product C", price: 14.99)
]

let sortedProducts = products.sorted()
print(sortedProducts.map { $0.name }) // ["Product B", "Product A", "Product C"]
3. Codable
The Codable protocol combines Encodable and Decodable, allowing types to be serialized to and from external data representations such as JSON. This is especially useful for networking, data persistence, and interoperability with APIs.

Requirements

If your type’s properties are Codable, Swift automatically synthesizes conformance. For custom serialization logic, you can implement encode(to:) and init(from:).

Example

struct User: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let email: String
}

// Encoding to JSON
let user = User(id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com")
if let jsonData = try? JSONEncoder().encode(user),
   let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8) {
    print(jsonString)
}

// Decoding from JSON
let json = """
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
}
"""
if let jsonData = json.data(using: .utf8),
   let decodedUser = try? JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: jsonData) {
    print(decodedUser.name) // John Doe
}
4. Identifiable
Identifiable is a protocol primarily used in SwiftUI for uniquely identifying instances within lists and other UI components. Each conforming type requires a unique id property, which helps SwiftUI differentiate elements in dynamic views.

Requirements

Implement an id property, which must be Hashable (often a UUID or unique attribute).

Example

struct Task: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID = UUID()
    let title: String
}

let tasks = [
    Task(title: "Buy groceries"),
    Task(title: "Complete project")
]
In SwiftUI:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    let tasks: [Task] = [ /* ... */ ]
    
    var body: some View {
        List(tasks) { task in
            Text(task.title)
        }
    }
}
5. CustomStringConvertible
CustomStringConvertible provides a custom string representation for a type by implementing a description property. This is useful for debugging and displaying custom objects in a human-readable format.

Requirements

Implement the description computed property, which returns a String representation of the type.

Example

struct Car: CustomStringConvertible {
    let make: String
    let model: String
    let year: Int
    
    var description: String {
        return "\(year) \(make) \(model)"
    }
}

let car = Car(make: "Tesla", model: "Model S", year: 2022)
print(car) // 2022 Tesla Model S
Summary

Swift's common protocols (Equatable, Comparable, Codable, Identifiable, and CustomStringConvertible) bring flexibility, clarity, and efficiency to your code. These protocols support critical operations such as equality checks, sorting, data encoding, unique identification, and readable output. Leveraging these protocols effectively simplifies many common tasks and enhances your app’s performance and maintainability.
