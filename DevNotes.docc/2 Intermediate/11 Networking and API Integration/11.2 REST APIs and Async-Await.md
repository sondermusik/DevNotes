# 11.2 REST APIs and Async/Await

**Learn how to streamline networking in Swift using REST APIs and the modern async/await paradigm for asynchronous programming.**

---

## Introduction

REST APIs (Representational State Transfer) are a cornerstone of modern application development, providing a way to interact with servers and fetch or send data. With Swift's introduction of **async/await**, handling asynchronous tasks like networking has become more intuitive, readable, and less prone to errors compared to traditional approaches using closures or delegates.

This guide explores **REST APIs and async/await**, focusing on practical usage, performance optimization, and advanced scenarios for desktop and cross-platform applications.

## 11.2.1 Fundamentals of REST APIs

### What Are REST APIs?

REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** to perform operations on resources. RESTful principles ensure statelessness, scalability, and interoperability between systems.

### Key Components
- **Endpoint:** The URL representing a resource (e.g., `/users/123`).
- **HTTP Methods:** Define operations (e.g., **GET** for reading data, **POST** for creating data).
- **Headers:** Metadata sent with requests (e.g., `Authorization`, `Content-Type`).
- **Body:** Data sent with certain requests, such as JSON payloads.

### Swift’s Tools for REST APIs
- **`URLSession`**: A robust API for handling HTTP requests.
- **Codable Protocol**: Enables straightforward encoding and decoding of JSON.

## 11.2.2 Using Async/Await for Networking

### Introduction to Async/Await

Introduced in Swift 5.5 and refined in Swift 6, async/await simplifies asynchronous programming by allowing you to write asynchronous code as if it were synchronous. It eliminates the complexity of nested closures and improves code readability.

### Basic Syntax
```swift
func fetchData() async throws -> Data {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data")!
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return data
}
Step-by-Step Example: Fetching Data from a REST API
Here’s how you can use async/await to fetch and decode JSON data:

struct User: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let email: String
}

func fetchUser(byID id: Int) async throws -> User {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/users/\(id)")!
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data)
}

// Usage
Task {
    do {
        let user = try await fetchUser(byID: 1)
        print("User: \(user.name)")
    } catch {
        print("Error fetching user: \(error)")
    }
}
11.2.3 Benefits of Async/Await

Readability and Maintainability
Async/await replaces nested closures with linear, easy-to-read code.
Improves debugging by making call stacks clearer.
Performance
Optimized for modern processors and Swift’s concurrency model.
Threads are freed up when awaiting, leading to better scalability.
Error Handling
Errors propagate using try and catch, maintaining consistent error-handling semantics.
11.2.4 Advanced Topics in REST APIs and Async/Await

Making POST Requests with Async/Await
struct NewUser: Codable {
    let name: String
    let email: String
}

func createUser(newUser: NewUser) async throws -> User {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/users")!
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
    request.httpBody = try JSONEncoder().encode(newUser)

    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
    return try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data)
}
Uploading Files Asynchronously
Swift’s async/await supports file uploads seamlessly:

func uploadFile(fileURL: URL, to serverURL: URL) async throws {
    var request = URLRequest(url: serverURL)
    request.httpMethod = "PUT"

    let (response, _) = try await URLSession.shared.upload(for: request, fromFile: fileURL)
    print("Upload response: \(response)")
}
Handling Rate Limiting
Implement retry logic to respect server rate limits:

func fetchDataWithRetry(url: URL, retries: Int = 3) async throws -> Data {
    for attempt in 1...retries {
        do {
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            return data
        } catch {
            if attempt == retries { throw error }
            await Task.sleep(2_000_000_000) // Wait 2 seconds
        }
    }
    throw URLError(.timedOut)
}
11.2.5 Cross-Platform Networking

Adapting Networking Code for Multiple Platforms
Swift allows platform-specific adaptations using conditional compilation:

#if os(iOS)
let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
#elseif os(macOS)
let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral
#endif
Networking in visionOS
Use background tasks for network operations to maintain UI responsiveness.
Minimize network latency to avoid disrupting user experience in immersive environments.
11.2.6 Best Practices for REST APIs with Async/Await

1. Use Codable for Parsing
Leveraging Codable ensures type safety and simplifies JSON parsing.

2. Centralize API Management
Create an API client to manage endpoints and configurations:

class APIClient {
    static let shared = APIClient()

    private let baseURL = URL(string: "https://api.example.com")!

    func makeRequest(endpoint: String) async throws -> Data {
        let url = baseURL.appendingPathComponent(endpoint)
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return data
    }
}
3. Secure Networking
Always use HTTPS.
Validate SSL certificates.
Store sensitive data securely (e.g., tokens in Keychain).
4. Handle Errors Gracefully
Provide meaningful error messages and fallbacks for a better user experience:

enum APIError: Error {
    case invalidResponse
    case serverError(String)
}
5. Optimize Performance
Enable caching with URLCache.
Avoid redundant API calls using memoization.
11.2.7 Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

1. Forgetting to Handle Timeouts
Set timeout intervals for better user feedback:

let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
configuration.timeoutIntervalForRequest = 10
let session = URLSession(configuration: configuration)
2. Blocking the Main Thread
Never use Task.sleep or synchronous calls in the main thread.

3. Ignoring HTTP Status Codes
Always inspect status codes to identify errors:

guard (200...299).contains(response.statusCode) else {
    throw URLError(.badServerResponse)
}
Conclusion

Using REST APIs with Swift's async/await enables clean, maintainable, and efficient networking code. By adopting best practices, handling edge cases, and optimizing for performance, you can create robust and scalable applications across macOS, iOS, visionOS, and other platforms.
