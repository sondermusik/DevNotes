## 1. Swift Error Handling Basics

### What Is an Error in Swift?

In Swift, an error is any type that conforms to the `Error` protocol. The protocol itself doesn’t define specific requirements, allowing developers to create errors that are highly customized for their needs.

#### Example: Simple Error Declaration

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case badURL
    case noInternetConnection
    case timeout
    case unknown
}
Throwing Errors
A function that can throw errors is marked with the throws keyword. Use the throw statement to signal an error.

Example: Throwing an Error

func fetchData(from url: String) throws -> String {
    guard url.starts(with: "https") else {
        throw NetworkError.badURL
    }
    // Simulated successful fetch
    return "Fetched Data"
}
Catching Errors
Handle errors using do-catch blocks. This allows you to define specific behaviors for different error types.

Example: Handling Specific Errors

do {
    let data = try fetchData(from: "http://example.com")
    print(data)
} catch NetworkError.badURL {
    print("Invalid URL: Please use a secure URL.")
} catch NetworkError.noInternetConnection {
    print("No internet connection. Please check your network.")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
Propagating Errors
Errors can be propagated to the caller by marking a function with the throws keyword.

Example: Propagating Errors

func processRequest() throws {
    try fetchData(from: "https://example.com")
}
2. Customizing Errors

Custom errors are powerful tools for providing detailed context about failures. Swift allows you to enhance errors with associated values, localized descriptions, and hierarchies.

Creating Custom Errors
Custom error types can be enums, structs, or classes. Enums are the most common choice due to their ability to group related cases.

Example: Adding Context with Associated Values

enum FileError: Error {
    case fileNotFound(fileName: String)
    case permissionDenied(fileName: String)
    case unknown
}

func readFile(named fileName: String) throws {
    throw FileError.fileNotFound(fileName: fileName)
}

do {
    try readFile(named: "document.txt")
} catch FileError.fileNotFound(let fileName) {
    print("File not found: \(fileName)")
}
Error Hierarchies
For complex systems, consider using a hierarchy of error types to group related errors.

Example: Error Hierarchy

protocol AppError: Error {}

enum DatabaseError: AppError {
    case connectionFailed
    case dataCorrupted
}

enum NetworkError: AppError {
    case timeout
    case badURL
}
Adding Localized Descriptions
Swift’s LocalizedError protocol allows you to provide user-friendly descriptions.

Example: LocalizedError

enum LoginError: LocalizedError {
    case invalidCredentials
    case userNotFound

    var errorDescription: String? {
        switch self {
        case .invalidCredentials:
            return "The username or password you entered is incorrect."
        case .userNotFound:
            return "No user found with the provided details."
        }
    }
}
3. The Result Type

The Result type simplifies error handling by encapsulating success and failure in a single value.

Basic Usage
func fetchUserData(completion: (Result<String, NetworkError>) -> Void) {
    let isSuccess = true
    if isSuccess {
        completion(.success("User data loaded."))
    } else {
        completion(.failure(.timeout))
    }
}

fetchUserData { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let data):
        print(data)
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failed with error: \(error)")
    }
}
Combining Result with Async Code
With async/await, you can use Result to simplify asynchronous workflows.

func fetchAsyncData(from url: String) async -> Result<String, NetworkError> {
    guard url.starts(with: "https") else {
        return .failure(.badURL)
    }
    return .success("Async Data")
}

Task {
    let result = await fetchAsyncData(from: "https://example.com")
    switch result {
    case .success(let data):
        print(data)
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
4. Error Handling Patterns

Graceful Recovery
Design applications to recover from errors without crashing or disrupting the user experience.

Example: Retry Mechanism

func fetchWithRetry(attempts: Int, url: String) async -> String? {
    for _ in 0..<attempts {
        if let data = try? await fetchAsyncData(from: url).get() {
            return data
        }
    }
    return nil
}
Logging Errors
Leverage os_log for system-level logging.

import os

let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.example.app", category: "networking")

func logError(_ error: Error) {
    logger.error("\(error.localizedDescription)")
}
5. Advanced Concepts

Wrapping and Chaining Errors
Error wrapping provides additional context to errors.

func wrappedErrorExample() throws {
    do {
        try fetchData(from: "http://example.com")
    } catch {
        throw NSError(domain: "com.example", code: 1, userInfo: [NSUnderlyingErrorKey: error])
    }
}
Converting Errors to Human-Readable Formats
Convert technical errors into user-friendly messages.

func errorMessage(for error: Error) -> String {
    switch error {
    case is NetworkError:
        return "A network error occurred. Please try again."
    case is FileError:
        return "File operation failed."
    default:
        return "An unexpected error occurred."
    }
}
6. Best Practices for Error Handling

Design Clear APIs: Avoid ambiguous error types; clearly document what each error represents.
Decouple Error Logic: Separate error handling from core logic using strategies like dependency injection.
Test Error Scenarios: Use unit tests to ensure your error-handling code behaves as expected.
Avoid Overusing Force Unwrapping: Prefer guard, if let, or Result to handle errors gracefully.
7. Real-World Scenarios

High-Performance Applications
Use structured error handling to isolate and address performance bottlenecks in desktop applications.

Cross-Platform Development
Ensure consistency in error messages and recovery mechanisms across platforms like macOS, iOS, and visionOS.

Debugging and Testing
Use XCTest to validate error conditions and recovery paths.

func testErrorThrowing() {
    XCTAssertThrowsError(try fetchData(from: "http://example.com")) { error in
        XCTAssertEqual(error as? NetworkError, .badURL)
    }
}
Summary

Swift’s error-handling mechanisms and the Result type provide developers with versatile tools to create robust, maintainable applications. By mastering these techniques, you can build software that handles failures gracefully, delivers exceptional user experiences, and meets the demands of modern cross-platform development.

Key takeaways:

Use custom error types for meaningful error messages.
Leverage Result for clear and concise error handling.
Adopt modern async/await patterns for high-performance workflows.
Follow best practices to ensure maintainable and user-friendly error management.
With these strategies, you can write Swift code that is both resilient and future-proof.# 9.6 Comprehensive Guide to Error Handling and Result Type in Swift
