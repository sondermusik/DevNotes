9.1 Protocols and Protocol-Oriented Programming in Swift

Overview: Learn about protocols as blueprints for structuring code, and how protocol-oriented programming (POP) can enhance flexibility, scalability, and code reusability in Swift.

Introduction to Protocols

In Swift, a protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, 
and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. Any class, struct, or enum can adopt protocols and implement their requirements, allowing different types to share a common functionality while maintaining their unique characteristics.

Protocols are a core feature of Swift, and their usage promotes better code organization, reduces redundancy, and encourages modularity.

Basic Protocol Definition
Here’s a simple example of a protocol:

protocol Describable {
    var description: String { get }
    func describe()
}
This protocol, Describable, requires any adopting type to have a description property and a describe method. Now, any struct, class, or enum that conforms to this protocol must implement these members.

struct Car: Describable {
    var description: String = "A vehicle with four wheels."
    
    func describe() {
        print(description)
    }
}
Protocol Adoption
Multiple types can adopt the same protocol, making it easier to standardize functionality across different types.

struct Animal: Describable {
    var description: String = "A living creature."
    
    func describe() {
        print(description)
    }
}
Protocol Composition and Inheritance

Protocols can be composed or inherited, which allows you to create complex types by combining simpler protocols.

Protocol Composition
You can combine multiple protocols using protocol composition, which provides a way to group multiple requirements without creating a new protocol.

protocol Flyable {
    func fly()
}

protocol Swimmable {
    func swim()
}

func performActions(on creature: Flyable & Swimmable) {
    creature.fly()
    creature.swim()
}
Protocol Inheritance
Protocols can inherit other protocols to build upon their requirements. For instance, we could combine Flyable and Swimmable into a new protocol called FlyingSwimmingCreature.

protocol FlyingSwimmingCreature: Flyable, Swimmable {}
Any type that conforms to FlyingSwimmingCreature would need to satisfy the requirements of both Flyable and Swimmable.

Protocol Extensions: Adding Default Implementations

Swift’s protocol extensions allow you to provide default implementations for any method or computed property. This feature is one of the foundations of protocol-oriented programming.

protocol Playable {
    func play()
}

extension Playable {
    func play() {
        print("Playing a generic game.")
    }
}

struct BoardGame: Playable {}

let game = BoardGame()
game.play() // Outputs: "Playing a generic game."
In this example, the BoardGame type doesn’t need to implement the play() method because the protocol extension provides a default implementation.

Overriding Default Implementations
Conforming types can override default implementations if they require custom behavior.

struct VideoGame: Playable {
    func play() {
        print("Playing an exciting video game!")
    }
}

let videoGame = VideoGame()
videoGame.play() // Outputs: "Playing an exciting video game!"
Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP)

Protocol-oriented programming (POP) is a paradigm popularized by Swift, focusing on using protocols and protocol extensions to create flexible, reusable, and modular code. In Swift, many standard library types are protocol-oriented (e.g., Collection, Equatable), which encourages developers to think in terms of protocols instead of relying solely on classes.

Why Use Protocol-Oriented Programming?
Decoupling: Protocols allow you to decouple code, making it more modular and testable.
Composition Over Inheritance: Protocols promote composition by letting you combine small pieces of functionality instead of building complex inheritance hierarchies.
Flexibility: Protocol extensions provide default behavior, making it easy to add or override functionality without subclassing.
Protocol-Oriented Programming in Action

Let’s illustrate POP by creating a hierarchy for representing geometric shapes.

protocol Shape {
    var area: Double { get }
    func displayInfo()
}

extension Shape {
    func displayInfo() {
        print("This shape has an area of \(area).")
    }
}
Now, we can define specific shapes like Rectangle and Circle, each conforming to the Shape protocol and providing its own implementation for the area property.

struct Rectangle: Shape {
    var width: Double
    var height: Double
    var area: Double {
        return width * height
    }
}

struct Circle: Shape {
    var radius: Double
    var area: Double {
        return .pi * radius * radius
    }
}
This setup allows us to treat both Rectangle and Circle as Shape, leveraging polymorphism without class inheritance.

let shapes: [Shape] = [Rectangle(width: 3, height: 4), Circle(radius: 5)]

for shape in shapes {
    shape.displayInfo()
}
Associated Types in Protocols

Associated types allow protocols to work with generic types without explicitly specifying their exact type. This feature is commonly used in collection protocols, like Collection and Sequence.

Defining a Protocol with an Associated Type
Here’s an example of a protocol with an associated type:

protocol Container {
    associatedtype Item
    var items: [Item] { get set }
    mutating func add(_ item: Item)
}
Any type that conforms to Container must specify the Item type and provide an implementation for the items property and add method.

struct IntContainer: Container {
    var items = [Int]()
    mutating func add(_ item: Int) {
        items.append(item)
    }
}
Associated types make protocols versatile, enabling them to work with a wide range of data types while maintaining type safety.

Protocols as Type Constraints in Generics

Protocols can act as constraints on generic types, providing additional flexibility in type-safe code.

func findLargest<T: Comparable>(_ items: [T]) -> T? {
    return items.max()
}
In this function, the generic type T is constrained to types that conform to Comparable, ensuring we can use the max() method.

Protocol-Oriented vs. Object-Oriented Programming

While both object-oriented programming (OOP) and protocol-oriented programming (POP) aim to achieve modularity and code reuse, they take different approaches:

Inheritance vs. Composition: OOP relies on inheritance hierarchies, which can become complex. POP, on the other hand, focuses on composition through protocols.
Behavior Sharing: OOP uses class inheritance to share behavior, which can lead to tight coupling. POP shares behavior through protocol extensions, allowing for more flexibility.
Testing and Mocking: Protocols are easier to mock for testing, as they provide abstract requirements that can be implemented differently in tests.
Protocol-Oriented Programming Best Practices

Use Protocols to Define Behavior: Create protocols that represent capabilities (e.g., Equatable, Hashable) instead of specific types.
Limit Protocol Scope: Protocols should define a focused set of behaviors. Avoid creating “fat” protocols with too many responsibilities.
Leverage Protocol Extensions: Use protocol extensions to provide default implementations and reduce code duplication.
Prefer Composition Over Inheritance: Compose functionality by conforming to multiple protocols rather than building deep inheritance trees.
Conclusion
Protocols and protocol-oriented programming offer powerful tools for building modular, reusable, and flexible Swift code. With protocol-oriented programming, you can design applications that scale and adapt across platforms like macOS, iOS, and watchOS, using protocols as blueprints and extensions for default behavior. Embracing these principles will help you write cleaner, more testable, and high-performance code, crucial for developing advanced applications in Swift.
