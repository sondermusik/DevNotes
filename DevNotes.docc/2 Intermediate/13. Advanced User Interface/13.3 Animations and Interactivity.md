## Animation Techniques

### Implicit Animations
Implicit animations automatically animate changes in properties.
- **SwiftUI Example:**
  ```swift
  struct ImplicitAnimationView: View {
      @State private var isScaled = false
      var body: some View {
          Circle()
              .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
              .scaleEffect(isScaled ? 2.0 : 1.0)
              .animation(.easeInOut, value: isScaled)
              .onTapGesture {
                  isScaled.toggle()
              }
      }
  }
Advantage: Minimal code for smooth effects tied to state changes.
Explicit Animations
Explicit animations provide finer control over how and when animations occur.

SwiftUI Example:
withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.5, dampingFraction: 0.6)) {
    isScaled.toggle()
}
UIKit Example:
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, delay: 0, options: [.curveEaseInOut]) {
    view.alpha = 0.0
}
Custom Timing Functions
Custom timing curves allow precise control over the pacing of animations.

Core Animation Example:
let animation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position")
animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeInEaseOut)
Interactive Animations

Gesture-Driven Animations
Interactive animations respond to user gestures for dynamic and immersive experiences.

SwiftUI Gesture Example:
struct DragAnimationView: View {
    @State private var offset = CGSize.zero
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
            .offset(offset)
            .gesture(
                DragGesture()
                    .onChanged { gesture in
                        offset = gesture.translation
                    }
                    .onEnded { _ in
                        withAnimation {
                            offset = .zero
                        }
                    }
            )
    }
}
UIKit Transition Animations
UIKit enables interactive transitions between views or view controllers.

Example:
let transition = CATransition()
transition.type = .push
transition.subtype = .fromRight
view.layer.add(transition, forKey: nil)
Advanced Topics

Custom Animation Curves
Custom curves are defined using cubic Bezier functions or keyframes for intricate effects.

Swift Example:
let customCurve = UICubicTimingParameters(controlPoint1: CGPoint(x: 0.25, y: 0.1), controlPoint2: CGPoint(x: 0.25, y: 1.0))
let animator = UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: 0.5, timingParameters: customCurve)
animator.startAnimation()
Cross-Platform Animation Logic
Shared animation code can be created using frameworks like SwiftUI for multiplatform consistency.

Example for visionOS:
@SceneBuilder var scene: some Scene {
    ContentView()
        .environment(\.animation, .easeInOut)
}

## Custom Animation Curves: Implementing Animations with Precise Control Using Core Animation

Animation curves dictate the timing and pacing of animations, offering a way to create visually appealing and natural motion. With Core Animation, developers can define custom curves to achieve precise control.

### Key Concepts:
- **CAMediaTimingFunction**: Allows for custom easing functions, such as linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.
- **Bezier Timing Functions**: Use cubic Bezier curves to create highly specific animation timing.
- **Spring Animations**: Provide a natural "bouncing" effect, ideal for modern UI designs.

### Practical Example:
```swift
let animation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position")
animation.fromValue = CGPoint(x: 50, y: 50)
animation.toValue = CGPoint(x: 250, y: 250)
animation.duration = 1.0
animation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(controlPoints: 0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0) // Custom cubic Bezier curve
layer.add(animation, forKey: "positionAnimation")
Insights:
Custom curves improve user engagement by mimicking real-world physics.
Use UIViewPropertyAnimator for fine-grained control in UIKit.

    var interactionInProgress = false
    private weak var viewController: UIViewController!

    init(viewController: UIViewController) {
        self.viewController = viewController
        super.init()
        prepareGestureRecognizer(in: viewController.view)
    }

    private func prepareGestureRecognizer(in view: UIView) {
        let panGesture = UIPanGestureRecognizer(target: this, action: #selector(handleGesture(_:)))
        view.addGestureRecognizer(panGesture)
    }

    @objc private func handleGesture(_ gestureRecognizer: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {
        let progress = gestureRecognizer.translation(in: gestureRecognizer.view).x / gestureRecognizer.view!.bounds.width
        switch gestureRecognizer.state {
        case .began:
            interactionInProgress = true
            viewController.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
        case .changed:
            update(progress)
        case .cancelled, .ended:
            interactionInProgress = false
            progress > 0.5 ? finish() : cancel()
        default:
            break
        }
    }
}
Insights:
