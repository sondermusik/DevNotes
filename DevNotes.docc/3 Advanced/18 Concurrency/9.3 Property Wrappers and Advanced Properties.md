Property Wrappers and Advanced Properties in Swift

A comprehensive guide to property wrappers, custom wrappers, and advanced property concepts in Swift.

Introduction

Swift property wrappers enable code reusability and encapsulation of property-related logic. This article covers built-in wrappers such as @State and @Published, explains how to create custom property wrappers, and explores advanced property concepts. Property wrappers are valuable in modern Swift development, particularly with SwiftUI, Combine, and the evolution of Swift toward declarative and reactive programming.

What are Property Wrappers?
Property wrappers encapsulate property logic in a reusable manner, providing consistent functionality across different properties. They allow you to:

Implement standard property behavior such as validation, caching, and state management.
Use attributes (@WrapperName) to automatically apply logic to a property.
Built-In Property Wrappers

Swift comes with several built-in property wrappers, especially useful for UI and state management.

@State
The @State property wrapper is used in SwiftUI to manage mutable data that belongs to a view and can trigger UI updates when changed.

import SwiftUI

struct CounterView: View {
    @State private var count = 0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Count: \(count)")
            Button("Increment") { count += 1 }
        }
    }
}
Usage: For view-local states in SwiftUI, where the view will handle its data without needing an external source.
Behavior: Modifying a @State variable will automatically re-render the view.
@Published
The @Published wrapper is part of Combine and is used to publish changes to a property that other objects can observe.

import Combine

class Counter: ObservableObject {
    @Published var count = 0
}
Usage: Attach @Published to a property within an ObservableObject class. Other objects subscribing to this object will receive updates whenever the property changes.
Behavior: Automatically emits changes for SwiftUI views or other subscribers.
@AppStorage and @SceneStorage
SwiftUI’s @AppStorage and @SceneStorage wrappers provide storage capabilities that automatically persist property values to UserDefaults or scene-specific storage.

import SwiftUI

struct UsernameView: View {
    @AppStorage("username") var username = "Guest"
    @SceneStorage("currentScene") var currentScene: String?

    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome, \(username)")
    }
}
@AppStorage: Used for persisting simple user preferences across app sessions.
@SceneStorage: Used for per-scene storage in multi-scene environments (e.g., iPadOS).
Creating Custom Property Wrappers

Custom property wrappers are highly flexible and useful for encapsulating repetitive property behavior like validation, formatting, or thread-safety.

Basic Custom Property Wrapper
To create a custom wrapper, define a struct, enum, or class that conforms to the PropertyWrapper protocol, and implement a wrappedValue property.

@propertyWrapper
struct Clamped<T: Comparable> {
    private var value: T
    let range: ClosedRange<T>

    var wrappedValue: T {
        get { value }
        set { value = min(max(range.lowerBound, newValue), range.upperBound) }
    }

    init(wrappedValue: T, _ range: ClosedRange<T>) {
        self.value = range.contains(wrappedValue) ? wrappedValue : range.lowerBound
        self.range = range
    }
}

struct Player {
    @Clamped(0...100) var health: Int = 50
}
Behavior: This wrapper clamps the health property to the 0...100 range, ensuring that health can’t exceed these bounds.
Usage: Any property that should be limited within a range can now use @Clamped.
Property Wrappers with Multiple Values
A wrapper can also store multiple values, such as a timestamped property.

@propertyWrapper
struct Timestamped<Value> {
    private(set) var value: Value
    private(set) var lastUpdated: Date

    var wrappedValue: Value {
        get { value }
        set {
            value = newValue
            lastUpdated = Date()
        }
    }

    init(wrappedValue: Value) {
        self.value = wrappedValue
        self.lastUpdated = Date()
    }
}

struct Task {
    @Timestamped var name: String
}
Behavior: Automatically updates lastUpdated whenever the name property is changed.
Usage: Useful for tracking the last modification time on a property.
Projecting a Value from a Property Wrapper
Property wrappers can also provide additional computed values via $propertyName syntax.

@propertyWrapper
struct ValidatedEmail {
    private var value: String
    var wrappedValue: String {
        get { value }
        set { value = newValue }
    }
    var projectedValue: Bool {
        return value.contains("@") && value.contains(".")
    }

    init(wrappedValue: String) {
        self.value = wrappedValue
    }
}

struct User {
    @ValidatedEmail var email: String
}

let user = User(email: "user@example.com")
print(user.$email) // Outputs `true` if the email is valid
Behavior: Exposes a projected $email property to check if the email format is valid.
Usage: Provides validation without external helper functions or classes.
Advanced Property Concepts in Swift

In addition to property wrappers, Swift properties have advanced features and behaviors that provide control over their usage and optimization.

Computed Properties
Computed properties are not stored in memory but are recalculated whenever accessed.

struct Circle {
    var radius: Double
    var area: Double {
        return .pi * radius * radius
    }
}
Property Observers
Properties can use willSet and didSet observers to respond to changes.

struct Stock {
    var price: Double {
        willSet {
            print("New price will be \(newValue)")
        }
        didSet {
            print("Price changed from \(oldValue) to \(price)")
        }
    }
}
Usage: Observers help execute code before or after a property is changed.
Lazy Properties
The lazy keyword defers the creation of a property until it is accessed for the first time. Lazy properties are especially helpful for expensive operations or large initializations.

struct DataLoader {
    lazy var data: [String] = loadData()

    func loadData() -> [String] {
        // Expensive data loading operation
        return ["Data1", "Data2"]
    }
}
Behavior: Only initialized when data is accessed, reducing memory usage.
Usage: Lazy properties are useful for on-demand initialization.
Static Properties
Static properties are shared across all instances of a type and are declared with the static keyword.

struct Configuration {
    static var apiEndpoint = "https://api.example.com"
}
Usage: For values that are common across all instances, such as configuration settings.
Property Wrapper Initializers
Property wrappers can have initializers to customize their behavior when applied.

@propertyWrapper
struct Capitalized {
    private var text: String

    var wrappedValue: String {
        get { text }
        set { text = newValue.capitalized }
    }

    init(wrappedValue: String) {
        self.text = wrappedValue.capitalized
    }
}

struct Document {
    @Capitalized var title: String
}
Behavior: Automatically capitalizes the title property on initialization or modification.
Usage: Useful for applying default formatting to properties.
Observable Properties for Multiplatform Applications
For cross-platform development in SwiftUI, @State, @Published, and @EnvironmentObject wrappers integrate with SwiftUI’s reactive framework. They allow state-driven views across platforms like macOS, iOS, watchOS, and visionOS.

@State: Used for view-specific local states.
@Published: Used in an ObservableObject for values that multiple views observe.
@EnvironmentObject: Shared object across views in a SwiftUI hierarchy.
When to Use Property Wrappers

Property wrappers are suitable for:

Cross-platform consistency: By encapsulating logic, you avoid repetitive code for different platforms.
Data validation and sanitization: Ensure properties always meet specific criteria, such as formatting.
On-demand calculations: Only calculate values when needed, optimizing resource usage.
State management: Especially for SwiftUI, property wrappers simplify state-driven UIs.
Conclusion

Property wrappers and advanced property features in Swift are essential tools for clean, reusable, and modular code. Whether using built-in wrappers or creating custom wrappers, these tools reduce boilerplate, enforce best practices, and contribute to building high-performance and cross-platform applications.

By understanding and applying these concepts, developers can create robust and efficient code, harnessing Swift’s capabilities for both desktop and multiplatform development.
