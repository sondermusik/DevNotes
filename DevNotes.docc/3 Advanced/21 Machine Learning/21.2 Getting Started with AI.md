## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines, enabling them to perform tasks such as reasoning, learning, and decision-making. It stands at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific expertise.

### AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Encompasses systems designed to mimic human intelligence at any level.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI focused on algorithms that improve automatically through data exposure.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: A further specialization of ML using neural networks with many layers to process data in complex ways.

Understanding these distinctions is key when determining the right approach for a problem.

## Core Concepts in AI for Developers
### Heuristics in AI
Heuristics are rule-of-thumb strategies used for problem-solving in AI when computational solutions are impractical.
- **Advantage**: Faster approximate solutions for complex problems.
- **Example**: Pathfinding in games using A* or Dijkstra’s algorithm.

### Knowledge Representation
AI systems require structured knowledge to reason effectively.
- **Semantic Networks**: Represent relationships between concepts.
- **Ontologies**: Formal definitions of domain-specific knowledge.
- **Real-World Use Case**: AI chatbots utilize ontology-based knowledge graphs to infer user intent.

### Reasoning and Decision-Making
AI employs inference engines and decision trees for reasoning:
- **Rule-Based Systems**: "If X, then Y" rules for deterministic decision-making.
- **Bayesian Networks**: Probabilistic models that accommodate uncertainty.

## AI Problem-Solving Framework
### Defining the Problem
Clearly articulate the objective, constraints, and desired outcomes.
- **Example**: Predicting customer churn in a subscription-based service.

### Data Collection and Preparation
- Gather relevant data, ensuring quality and diversity.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, outliers, and trends.

### Selecting Algorithms
Choose algorithms based on the nature of the problem:
- **Classification**: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees.
- **Clustering**: K-Means, DBSCAN.
- **Optimization**: Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing.

### Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using metrics such as:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score for classification tasks.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R² for regression tasks.
