# 17.3 Classes, Structs, and Actors in Swift
A comprehensive guide to understanding and using classes, structs, and actors in Swift for modern, high-performance, and cross-platform app development.

---

## Introduction to Classes, Structs, and Actors
Swift offers three primary constructs for defining data and behavior in your applications: classes, structs, and actors. These are fundamental building blocks for object-oriented, protocol-oriented, and concurrent programming in Swift. While they may appear similar, their differences make them suited to specific use cases, especially when designing for macOS, iOS, visionOS, and beyond.

## Classes in Swift

### What Are Classes?
Classes are reference types that enable encapsulation of data and functionality. They support inheritance, enabling you to build complex hierarchies and share behavior across related types.

```swift
class Vehicle {
    var speed: Double = 0.0
    func accelerate() {
        speed += 10.0
    }
}
Key Features of Classes
Reference Semantics: Classes are stored as references, allowing multiple variables to point to the same instance.
Inheritance: Classes can inherit properties, methods, and functionality from other classes.
Deinitialization: Classes support deinit, allowing cleanup when an instance is deallocated.
Advantages of Using Classes
Ideal for scenarios requiring shared mutable state.
Enable polymorphism, making them powerful for complex object-oriented designs.
Provide flexibility for patterns like dependency injection.
Performance Considerations
Reference counting introduces a performance cost due to Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).
Reference semantics can lead to unintended side effects if shared states are not carefully managed.
Structs in Swift

What Are Structs?
Structs are value types that encapsulate data and functionality. They are passed by copy, ensuring immutability unless explicitly marked mutable.

struct Point {
    var x: Double
    var y: Double
}
Key Features of Structs
Value Semantics: Each instance of a struct is independent, making them safer for concurrent and multithreaded programming.
Automatic Memberwise Initializers: Swift generates an initializer for structs automatically.
Performance Optimization: Structs are stored directly on the stack, avoiding the overhead of ARC for simple data models.
When to Use Structs
Use for lightweight, immutable data models like points, vectors, or configurations.
Recommended for scenarios requiring thread safety and reduced memory overhead.
Comparing Classes and Structs

| Feature              | Classes                     | Structs                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Type                | Reference                   | Value                       |
| Memory Allocation   | Heap                        | Stack                       |
| Inheritance         | Supported                   | Not supported               |
| ARC Overhead        | Yes                         | No                          |
| Thread Safety       | Requires care               | Thread-safe by default      |

Best Practices
Favor structs for immutable data and lightweight objects.
Use classes when inheritance or shared mutable state is essential.
Actors in Swift

What Are Actors?
Actors are a concurrency-safe reference type introduced in Swift 5.5 as part of the structured concurrency model. They provide a thread-safe environment for managing mutable state.

actor Counter {
    private var value = 0
    func increment() {
        value += 1
    }
    func getValue() -> Int {
        value
    }
}
Key Features of Actors
Isolation: Actors serialize access to their mutable state, preventing data races.
Concurrency: Designed for async/await patterns, actors seamlessly integrate into Swift’s concurrency model.
Reference Semantics: Like classes, actors are reference types but are thread-safe.
Actor vs. Class
Actors provide thread-safety out of the box, unlike classes, which require explicit synchronization.
They cannot be subclassed, ensuring consistent behavior and safety.
Using Actors in Practice
Ideal for managing shared state in concurrent environments.
Commonly used for UI-related state management with @MainActor.
Design Patterns and Best Practices

Choosing Between Classes, Structs, and Actors
Use Structs for:
Immutable data structures.
Value semantics (e.g., points, vectors, or settings).
Use Classes for:
Complex hierarchies requiring inheritance.
Scenarios needing shared mutable state or polymorphism.
Use Actors for:
Concurrent programming.
Managing mutable state in a thread-safe manner.
Combining Structs, Classes, and Actors
Hybrid designs leverage the strengths of all three constructs. For instance:

Use structs for immutable data passed between layers.
Use classes for dependency injection and shared services.
Use actors for thread-safe state management.
Advanced Topics and Future Directions

Integration with SwiftUI and Combine
Use structs for lightweight view models in SwiftUI.
Employ classes for shared services, such as data controllers.
Leverage actors for managing complex state in async/await workflows.
Concurrency and Performance
Avoid overusing actors for fine-grained tasks to prevent serialization bottlenecks.
Profile and balance between actor and non-actor code to ensure optimal performance.
Limitations and Pitfalls
Classes: Be cautious of retain cycles and excessive ARC overhead.
Structs: Avoid excessive copying for large structs.
Actors: Watch for serialization delays in high-contention environments.
Conclusion

Classes, structs, and actors form the foundation of Swift’s type system. By understanding their characteristics, performance implications, and best practices, you can design high-performance, scalable, and maintainable applications tailored to modern platforms like macOS, iOS, visionOS, and AppleCarPlay.

Use these constructs wisely to harness the full power of Swift, ensuring your applications are not only performant but also easy to maintain and extend.
